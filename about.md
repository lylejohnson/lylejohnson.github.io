Welcome to my web log. For the most part, this web log is about software projects I&#8217;m working on or am interested in, but I&#8217;ll also occasionally write about something that has nothing at all to do with computers. I&#8217;m a software engineer living in Madison, Alabama and working in Huntsville, Alabama. I&#8217;m the creator and former developer of [FXRuby](http://www.fxruby.org/), a software library that enables software developers writing in the [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) progamming language to use the [FOX](http://www.fox-toolkit.org/) graphical user interface toolkit. I&#8217;m the author of <cite>FXRuby: Create Lean and Mean GUIs with Ruby</cite>, and a co-author of <cite>Ruby Developer&#8217;s Guide</cite>.
