This is my list of recommended resources for new Ruby and Rails programmers. Or even old ones.

## Web Sites

There are a lot of Ruby and Rails-related web sites and blogs out there. Here are a few that I find useful, especially for beginners.

  * The [Ruby Home Page](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) is a good place to start to learn about the language, the community, news and upcoming events, and all things Ruby.
  * Likewise, the [Ruby on Rails Home Page](http://www.rubyonrails.com/) includes a number of valuable resources, including the now-famous screencasts that helped to jump-start Rails acceptance.
  * [Ruby-Doc.org](http://www.ruby-doc.org/) collects all kinds of documentation about Ruby, including comprehensive documentation for the core and standard libraries.
  * [Ruby Inside](http://rubyinside.com/) is Peter Cooper&#8217;s portal site for Ruby and Rails news.
  * [Ruby Quiz](http://www.rubyquiz.com/) is a weekly programming challenge for Ruby programmers. You can see archives of previous Ruby quizzes (along with their solutions) at the web site. There&#8217;s also a [book](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_quiz/) that collects some of the best quizzes.
  * [Nuby on Rails](http://nubyonrails.com/) is Geoffrey Grosenbach&#8217;s Ruby on Rails site for newbies.
  * Ryan Bates hosts free weekly screencasts featuring Ruby on Rails tips and tricks, at [Railscasts](http://railscasts.com/).
  * The [PeepCode](http://peepcode.com/) screencasts aren&#8217;t free, but they are highly recommended as a way to learn Rails.
  * [RubyLearning](http://rubylearning.com/) offers a [free online course](http://rubylearning.org/class/) in Ruby programming (as well as courses on other related topics).

## Books

These books are widely considered to be some of the best on Ruby and Rails programming.

  * <cite>Programming Ruby (2nd ed.)</cite>, Dave Thomas [[Look](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html)]
  * <cite>The Ruby Way (2nd ed.)</cite>, Hal Fulton [[Look](http://www.amazon.com/Ruby-Way-Second-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/0672328844)]
  * <cite>Agile Web Development with Rails (2nd ed.)</cite>, Dave Thomas et al [[Look](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails2/index.html)]
  * _The Well-Grounded Rubyist_, David Black [[Look](http://www.manning.com/black2/)]
  * <cite>Ruby Cookbook</cite>, Lucas Carlson and Leonard Richardson [[Look](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/rubyckbk/)]
  * <cite>Rails Cookbook</cite>, Rob Orsini [[Look](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/9780596527310/)]

## Training

  * The [Pragmatic Studio](http://pragmaticstudio.com/) offers both public and private (on-site) training in [Ruby](http://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby-intro/), [Advanced Ruby](http://pragmaticstudio.com/ruby) and [Ruby on Rails](http://pragmaticstudio.com/rails), among other subjects.
  * [Ruby Power and Light](http://rubypal.com/training) also offers Ruby and Rails training.

## Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)

You&#8217;ll find that many Ruby and Rails developers eschew heavyweight IDEs in favor of powerful editors like [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) and [TextMate](http://www.macromates.com/). I am one of those people. Nevertheless, there are now a lot of good choices for more comprehensive IDEs, and you may find that one of them suits you better. Here are a few IDEs that I know of.

  * [Aptana RadRails](http://www.aptana.com/download_rails_rdt.php) is an Eclipse-based IDE for Ruby on Rails. It&#8217;s available both as a standalone application and as a plugin for Eclipse 3.2.
  * [NetBeans 6.0 Beta](http://www.netbeans.org/community/releases/60/index.html) has what I&#8217;m told is excellent support for Ruby.
  * ActiveState&#8217;s [Komodo Edit](http://www.activestate.com/Products/komodo_edit/?CMP=ILC-koedi0407) is a free, multi-language editor for dynamic languages and Ajax technologies.
