Dave Thomas [writes](http://pragdave.pragprog.com/pragdave/2007/05/paying_back.html "Paying Back") that, so far, attendees of [RailsConf 2007](http://railsconf.com/ "RailsConf 2007 Home Page") have donated about $33,000 to selected charities. It&#8217;s my understanding that there were about 1600 attendees, so that averages out to over $20 per person (again, so far).

My mind immediately went back to a [story](http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20070426/WVUA01/70426023/-1/NEWS03 "A-Day Drive Raises Forty Thousand Dollars for Enterprise Residents") I recently heard about the A-Day football game at the University of Alabama back in April. That day, fundraisers at Bryant-Denny Stadium were accepting donations to be used towards relief for victims of the [tornado](http://www.edendailynews.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=Common%2FMGArticle%2FPrintVersion&c=MGArticle&cid=1149193481054&oasDN=eprisenow.com&oasPN=!news!localnews!index.shtml&image=ent80x60.gif) that struck Enterprise, Alabama on March 1. If you&#8217;ve forgotten the story, this was the F-4 tornado that (among other things) destroyed Enterprise High School, killing eight high school students when part of the school collapsed on them.

The University of Alabama experienced [record attendance](http://www.tuscaloosanews.com/article/20070423/WVUA01/70423015/1010/NEWS05 "Record-Breaking Attendance at This Year's A-Day Game") at this year&#8217;s A-Day game. With more than 92,000 fans in attendance, &#8220;<span class="body_text">fire marshals had to turn fans away because Bryant-Denny stadium was full.&#8221; Despite these overwhelming numbers, fundraisers collected a little less than $40,000 that day. Assuming that the numbers are even approximately close, that averages to less than fifty cents donated per person in attendance.</span>

The point of all this isn&#8217;t to bash Alabama fans &#8212; not that that&#8217;s not a worthy pursuit in and of itself. It&#8217;s a little bit of an apples and oranges comparison to begin with, considering that at least some of the RailsConf donations came from companies and not individuals, and that a lot of the Alabama fans had no doubt made donations through their churches or other organizations.

The point is that this has the promise of becoming a great side benefit of Ruby and Rails conferences to come. Competitive geeks that we are, each new group of conference attendees will try to break the record for donations. I don&#8217;t attend a lot of technical conferences, so maybe this is something that is more common than I realize. Regardless, it&#8217;s another great reason to be a part of this community.
