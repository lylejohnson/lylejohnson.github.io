The first issue of [_Ruby Code & Style_](http://www.artima.com/rubycs/), an online magazine from Artima, is now available. Editors James Britt and Shashank Date have done a fantastic job, along with Bill Venners and the members of the _Ruby Code & Style_ advisory board, to provide this new resource for Ruby developers. So check it out! And if you were somehow unaware of the [Artima Developer web site](http://www.artima.com/) before this, be sure to check out the rest of the site as well.
