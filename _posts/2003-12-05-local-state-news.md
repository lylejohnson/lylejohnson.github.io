The Associated Press reports that [Auburn High School](http://www.auburnschools.org/ahs) senior Cameron Coles scored a perfect 36 on the ACT. He was the only student in Alabama, and one of five nationwide, to do so during the September testing. AHS is my alma mater (class of 1988) and so this is especially nice to see.

Also from the AP, [&#8220;American Idol&#8221;](http://www.idolonfox.com/home.htm) winner Ruben Studdard (from Birmingham, Alabama) is nominated for best male R&B vocal performance for his performance of &#8220;Superstar&#8221;, from his upcoming solo album &#8220;Soulful&#8221;. &#8220;Idol&#8221; runner-up [Clay Aiken](http://www.msmindy.com/rudolph/images/ch_hermey_tn.jpg) received no nominations for &#8220;Measure of a Man&#8221;, his major-label debut.
