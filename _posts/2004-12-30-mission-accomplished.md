Well, sort of. When I finally conceded that I was spending _way_ too much time worrying about how to get the iBook to play nice with the old wireless router, I headed out to CompUSA and bought the NETGEAR WGR614 router. Yes, I took the coward&#8217;s way out, but it was worth the $50 or so (after rebate) to get this problem resolved, especially since my time was running out (Denise returns home today).

All of our computers, including the new iBook, are connecting just fine now. Thanks to those of you who responded with suggestions.
