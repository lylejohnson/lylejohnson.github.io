[Stefano Mazzocchi](http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/) has reprinted Frank Manola&#8217;s parody of the original Semantic Web [article](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?articleID=00048144-10D2-1C70-84A9809EC588EF21&catID=2) by Tim Berners-Lee and friends, from way back in 2001. In the original article we&#8217;re treated to a day in the life of &#8220;Pete&#8221; and &#8220;Lucy&#8221;, two fictional characters whose lives are made easier by the advent of the Semantic Web. In Frank&#8217;s updated version of the story, Pete&#8217;s Semantic Web agent has to pause for three hours to download the latest patches for Microsoft Agent before it can proceed in its work.
