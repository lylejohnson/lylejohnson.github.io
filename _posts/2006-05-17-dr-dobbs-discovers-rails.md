The June issue of [Dr. Dobbs Journal](http://www.ddj.com/dept/architect/187203512?pgno=1) includes an article about an exciting new web framework called &#8220;Rails&#8221;.

Sigh. I remember when I used to read DDJ religiously. I remember when they were one of the first &#8220;big-name&#8221; software magazines to publish an article about Ruby. But for various reasons, the content of DDJ over the last few years has become increasingly irrelevant to me. Is this really the first time that they&#8217;ve covered Rails?
