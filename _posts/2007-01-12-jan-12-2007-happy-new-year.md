How bad is it that the most exciting thing that&#8217;s happened in my life this week is the announcement of the [iPhone](http://www.apple.com/iphone/)?

Sometimes I wonder if I&#8217;m having a mid-life crisis. Is 36 (almost 37) years old too young to have a mid-life crisis? Is this as good as it gets, getting up and going to work and doing the same thing every day? When I think about the possibility that we&#8217;re never going to be matched for an adoption and that I&#8217;ll probably be childless for the rest of my life, I really worry about what happens next. Well, maybe &#8220;worry&#8221; isn&#8217;t the right word so much as &#8220;dread.&#8221; What is there to look forward to?

I&#8217;m not one to make New Year&#8217;s resolutions, because like most people I don&#8217;t ever stick to them. So I guess I feel like I&#8217;m being more honest about it up-front by just not making them in the first place. But one of the changes that I want to make this year has to do with this blog: I either want to start writing a lot more, or just get rid of it. It&#8217;s definitely kind of pointless as-is, with sporadic posts about whatever happens to be interesting to me at the time. I&#8217;ve noticed that I&#8217;m especially bad about starting what should be a series of posts and then losing steam shortly after completing the first one. It&#8217;s also been almost exclusively technical in nature, and while I don&#8217;t want for it to turn into a cat blog 

<img style="padding: 10px 0 5px 10px;" src="http://lylejohnson.name/images/Oscar.jpg" width="320" height="240" align="right" />I do intend to start writing more about what&#8217;s going on (or what isn&#8217;t) in real life.

The other change that I&#8217;d like to make this year is that, like everyone, I&#8217;d like to get in better physical shape. I don&#8217;t mean lose weight so much as start exercising more and eating more healthy. But that&#8217;s probably not going to happen. I think I will settle for &#8220;not getting any worse.&#8221;

Sorry for ending on a down note, but I&#8217;ve been sick for a couple of weeks now with a cough that won&#8217;t quite go away, and so that&#8217;s got me a little more discouraged than usual. Maybe I&#8217;ll have something more upbeat to tell after this weekend.
