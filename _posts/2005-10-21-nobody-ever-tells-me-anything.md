I just found out by accident that a movie of Neil Gaiman&#8217;s [_Coraline_](http://www.mousecircus.com/coraline/flash/coraline.html) is in the works. The report is that Dakota Fanning will be providing the voice of Coraline, which is fine I suppose. Looks like it&#8217;s going to be an animated feature, which also sounds promising; the director is Henry Selick, who also directed [&#8220;The Nightmare Before Christmas&#8221;](http://imdb.com/title/tt0107688/) and [&#8220;James and the Giant Peach&#8221;](http://imdb.com/title/tt0116683/). Finally, there&#8217;s a thread on the [IMDb](http://imdb.com/) message board for the movie that claims that [They Might Be Giants](http://www.tmbg.com/) are providing the soundtrack.
