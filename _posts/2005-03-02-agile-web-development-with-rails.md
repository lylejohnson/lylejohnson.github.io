I knew that Dave Thomas was working on a book about [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/) but didn&#8217;t know that any real information about that book&#8217;s status was available. To answer that question, Andy just posted an [article](http://www.toolshed.com/blog/News/rails.html,v) pointing to the entry for [_Agile Web Development with Rails_](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/rails/index.html) (available for purchase &#8220;on or about&#8221; July 4, 2005) at the Pragmatic Bookshelf Web site.
