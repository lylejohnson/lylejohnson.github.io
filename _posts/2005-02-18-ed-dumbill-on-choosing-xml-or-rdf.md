Ed Dumbill has posted a nice short [analysis](http://usefulinc.com/edd/blog/2005/2/18#08:52) of why he chose RDF instead of plain old XML for [DOAP](http://usefulinc.com/doap).

When he&#8217;s talking about the benefits of using RDF, it&#8217;s not really anything I hadn&#8217;t heard before when people are extolling the virtues of RDF; but it really helps to see what those benefits mean in the context of a _specific_ application like DOAP. He wanted a decentralized system for describing projects and the relations between them and the people working on them, recognizing that any one source is unlikely to know all of those things about a project. He wanted the DOAP vocabulary to be easily extensible, not only by established ontologies like [Dublin Core](http://www.dublincore.org/) and [FOAF](http://www.foaf-project.org/), but by as-yet-unknown vocabularies.
