[Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com) is hosting the world premiere of the [Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide to the Galaxy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0371724/) movie trailer on their web site. I&#8217;m trying to maintain a positive attitude about it, despite the fact that I know that things won&#8217;t look _exactly_ like I pictured them when I was reading the books. After all, the _X-Men_ movies turned out so much better than I thought they would.

Also looks like the release date has been pushed up to April 29 (presumably to beat [Episode III](http://imdb.com/title/tt0121766/) to the punch).
