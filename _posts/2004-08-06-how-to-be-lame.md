Was googling to find out what it means when someone says &#8220;re&#8221; in IRC, when I came across this helpful tutorial: [&#8220;How To Be Lame&#8221;](http://files.dambedai.de/funnylinks/belame.htm). A sample from Lesson #4:

> _die is the most common response to anything and everything. whenever someone makes a 1% or more serious statement (or a request), just put a little ‘die’ or ‘dieplz’ after.</p> 
> 
> Example:</em>
> 
> <pre>&lt;person1&gt; i think this channel needs moderating
&lt;person2&gt; die
</pre></blockquote>
