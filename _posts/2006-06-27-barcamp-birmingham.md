I&#8217;ve just learned of a [Birmingham BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/BarCampBirmingham) that&#8217;s being organized for August 25-26, and I&#8217;m thinking about attending.

To be honest, although I&#8217;ve heard of the BarCamp idea before, I don&#8217;t know a lot about them. I know that they were instituted in response to the closed, invitation-only Foo Camp that O&#8217;Reilly sponsors every year. The primary [rule of Bar Camp](http://barcamp.org/TheRulesOfBarCamp) is that all of the attendees must give a demo, or make a presentation, or at least help with one. So I&#8217;d need to come up with something to present, and that shouldn&#8217;t be too tough, although it appears that most of the propsed (or requested) sessions so far seem to focus on web stuff.
