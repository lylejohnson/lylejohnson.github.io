Also on my list of phrases that need to be retired: &#8220;chilling effect.&#8221; One of the latest specimens, from this San Francisco Chronicle [article](http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/07/12/DDGHK7JE0V1.DTL) on an upcoming PBS show:

> _&#8220;With the excising of three not-so-little terms &#8212; &#8220;s &#8212; ,&#8221; &#8220;f &#8212; &#8221; and &#8220;blow job,&#8221; &#8212; from a forthcoming drama on PBS, the Hollywood creative community and broadcasters are finding, not to their liking, that a **chilling effect** on content has already taken place.&#8221;_Yes, it is a sad, sad day when I can&#8217;t hear the &#8220;F&#8221; word on PBS. Let me get my sweater.

Maybe &#8220;chilling effect&#8221; is the new &#8220;gravitas.&#8221; I seem to have heard that expression more in the last few years than I&#8217;ve heard it in my entire life. According to [google.com](http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&ie=UTF-8&q=chilling+effect&btnG=Google+Search), the phrase &#8220;chilling effect&#8221; now has its own [web site](http://www.chillingeffects.org/). In case you&#8217;re keeping score, some of the things that have chilling effects on other things are: 

  * The U.S. Treasury Department&#8217;s embargo on countries like Cuba, Iran, Syria and Sudan has a [chilling effect](http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/WEBONLY/wonews/oct03/1003ofac.html) on the IEEE&#8217;s ability to work with engineers in those countries. 
      * The U.S. response to the 9/11 terrorist attacks has a [chilling effect](http://www.eff.org/Privacy/Surveillance/Terrorism/antiterrorism_chill.html) on &#8220;information [available] on the Internet as well as &#8230; people trying to provide this information.&#8221; 
          * The Digital Millenium Copyright Act (DMCA) has a [chilling effect](http://www.gigalaw.com/articles/2001/landau-2001-09.html) on encryption research. 
              * The arrest of a doctor on drug trafficking charges had a [chilling effect](http://www.ama-assn.org/amednews/2003/10/27/prsc1027.htm) on the ability of other doctors to prescribe OxyContin. 
                  * The Dallas Cowboys&#8217; conservative playing style against Philadelphia had a [chilling effect](http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/sports/blinebury/2278316) on the Cowboys&#8217; receivers. 
                      * A Purdue University research warns that computer viruses may have a [chilling effect](http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1759,1612814,00.asp) on people&#8217;s willingness to go online. 
                          * Coverage of the Kobe Bryant rape case may have a [chilling effect](http://www.messenger-inquirer.com/features/perspective/7282529.htm) on rape victims coming forth. </ul>And that&#8217;s just the tip of the iceberg. One can only hope that the global warming crisis will help to reverse this trend.</p>
