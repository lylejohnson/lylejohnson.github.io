After a month&#8217;s reflection, I have decided that my favorite Christmas gift from 2003 was a copy of &#8220;Gigantic: A Tale of Two Johns&#8221;:http://www.giganticfilm.com. It was an especially significant gift for me since it was given to me by my mother-in-law, who personally went into her local Suncoast store and asked for this DVD.

??Gigantic?? is a documentary about the band &#8220;They Might Be Giants&#8221;:http://www.tmbg.com, and the two Johns are John Linnell and John Flansburgh, the band&#8217;s core members. I&#8217;ve been a fan of TMBG since 1989 or so, when my friend Gene Hwang introduced me to them. They&#8217;ve made a lot of great records since then, of course, but &#8220;Ana Ng&#8221; (from ??Lincoln??) will probably always be my favorite TMBG song.

For me, the best thing about the film is the footage from various concerts. I&#8217;ve always wanted to see Them perform live, but unless they get inspired to add some Alabama tour dates one of these days it seems increasingly unlikely that I&#8217;ll have that opportunity. The interview segments that appear throughout the film are also nice, and they illustrate how humble and unassuming Linnell and Flansburgh really are about what they&#8217;re doing. The DVD&#8217;s bonus features, such as the music videos for a lot of their early songs (including &#8220;Ana Ng&#8221;), are the icing on the cake. Probably the only thing I _didn&#8217;t_ like about the film was the inclusion of various actors performing dramatic readings of the lyrics of TMBG songs. For example, we get to see Michael McKean reciting &#8220;I Palindrome I&#8221;. I understand what they were going for, and I&#8217;m a fan of McKean and some of the other featured actors, but it just didn&#8217;t work.

If you&#8217;ve never heard They Might Be Giants, and you&#8217;re looking to expand your musical horizons a bit, you might want to pick up ??Dial A Song: 20 Years of They Might Be Giants??. This is a 2-CD anthology, released in 2002, and features 52 of their best songs.
