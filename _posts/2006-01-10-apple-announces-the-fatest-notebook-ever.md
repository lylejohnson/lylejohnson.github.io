Well, Steve referred to it as the [&#8220;fastest notebook ever.&#8221;](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/) Don&#8217;t know if that means the fastest _Apple_ notebook ever, or fastest notebook ever made by _anybody_.

Oh, who cares; I want one. It&#8217;s just as well that I can&#8217;t afford one right now anyways. By the time I can, they will be well past the first revision of these suckers and more native applications will be available. Perhaps the price will even have dropped by then. Sigh.
