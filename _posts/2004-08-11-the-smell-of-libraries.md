Leo Sauermann has posted a nice, short [essay](http://leobard.twoday.net/stories/300031/) about the social component of visiting a &#8220;brick-and-mortar&#8221; library that&#8217;s missing from our current conceptions of the Semantic Web: 

> _&#8220;For thousands of years we had to walk [to the library] to get to the information. This means, you meet people there, that search for the same stuff as you do. These people are interested in the same stuff as you. You may like to meet them.&#8221;_Leo&#8217;s obviously not the first person to comment on the internet&#8217;s negative effects on our social interaction, but I don&#8217;t know that I&#8217;ve ever seen this particular metaphor used. It&#8217;s a good read.
