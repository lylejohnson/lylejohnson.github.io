> A _demi-entendre_ is an expression or phrase that comes from accidentally combining two common expressions&#8230; For example, when you combine 

> _Give us something to hang our hats on._ with 

> _Give us something to sink our teeth into._ you get 

> &#8220;Give us something to hang our teeth on.&#8221; (Atlanta advertising agency director Selena Smith, as quoted in the [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/26/politics/26voices.html?pagewanted=2)).
