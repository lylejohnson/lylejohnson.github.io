I just visited Progressive&#8217;s [Drive](http://www.driveinsurance.com/) Insurance web site to try to get auto insurance quotes. I can enter my zip code, and the fact that I&#8217;m looking for car insurance, but the party&#8217;s over when I click the button to request quotes: 

> _Unfortunately, we cannot provide you with a quote online. We require that you have Internet Explorer version 6.0 or newer to get a quote online. Our systems indicate that your browser is an older version or does not otherwise meet this requirement. We apologize for the inconvenience._This isn&#8217;t a complete surprise, as I&#8217;m using Safari on Mac OS X. So I fired up Firefox instead.

No luck there, either &#8212; they really have hard-coded their site for IE. How ironic is it that a company named &#8220;Progressive&#8221; has such a late 1990&#8217;s approach to web site design? I honestly don&#8217;t remember the last web site I visited that just refused to work with non-IE browsers. I mean, even Microsoft&#8217;s own web sites don&#8217;t require IE.
