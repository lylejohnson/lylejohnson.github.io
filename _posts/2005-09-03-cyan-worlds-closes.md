About a week ago I added Cyan Worlds&#8217; Headquarters as one of my [43 places](http://43places.com/). Today I read on [Slashdot](http://games.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/03/2153211&tid=187&tid=10) that, as of last Friday, they&#8217;ve closed. (Actually, it&#8217;s the second time in as many days that Slashdot&#8217;s reported this news, but if you&#8217;re a regular reader of Slashdot, you&#8217;re used to that sort of redundancy in their reporting).

The fifth and last installment in the _Myst_ series, [_Myst V: End of Ages_](http://www.mystvgame.com/us/), is due to be released by Ubisoft on September 20. [Beenox Studios](http://www.beenox.com/index_en.html) is developing the Mac OS X version of _Myst V_ and lists its target release date as September 20 as well.
