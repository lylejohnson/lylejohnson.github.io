According to [this CNN.com story](http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/ptech/12/16/fcc.airtravelers.ap/index.html), the FCC will, in 2005, start taking public comment on whether the ban on using cell phones during flights should be lifted. Other than the obvious technical issues, such as whether airborne cell phone calls could interfere with a plane&#8217;s navigation and electrical systems, there&#8217;s this concern:

> _&#8220;The ability to communicate is a vital one, but good cell phone etiquette is also essential,&#8221; FCC Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein said. &#8220;Our job is to see if this is possible and then let consumers work out the etiquette.&#8221;_I wonder if Mr. Adelstein has been out in public anywhere during the last five years. If the &#8220;consumers&#8221; haven&#8217;t managed to work out cell phone etiquette on the ground, why should I have any expectation that they&#8217;ll do any better at 35,000 feet?
