OK, I promised Andy I wouldn&#8217;t post [this link](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/talks/Ruby/RubyInsurgency.pps.zip) until the first of the month. He kindly dug up the original PowerPoint presentation for his &#8220;Ruby Insurgency&#8221; talk from the first Ruby Conference, and has now published it at the Pragmatic Programmers&#8217; web site. Thanks, Andy!
