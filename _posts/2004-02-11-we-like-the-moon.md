Yesterday morning, I was trying to get to the [Quizno&#8217;s web site](http://www.quiznos.com) to see if I could see their latest commercials (the ones featuring those singing, um, things) but I kept getting redirected to a parking page at Network Solutions. So after a little more googling I ended up at Joel Veitch&#8217;s [rathergood.com](http://rathergood.com), where I got to see the [performance](http://www.rathergood.com/moon_song) that inspired the Quizno&#8217;s commercials as well as a number of other gems. Todd also sent me a link to the &#8220;Hey Ya, Charlie Brown!&#8221; animation, which made for a nice way to end the day.
