Blogger recently added support for newsfeeds to its free service but I hadn&#8217;t started experimenting with them until today. I got those turned on, but it appeared that [RSSOwl](http://rssowl.org/) was getting hung up trying to read the Blogger-generated Atom feed. Luckily, Blogger pointed me to [FeedBurner](http://www.feedburner.com), a site that will do on-the-fly conversion of Blogger&#8217;s Atom feeds back into RSS 2.0 (or any number of other formats).
