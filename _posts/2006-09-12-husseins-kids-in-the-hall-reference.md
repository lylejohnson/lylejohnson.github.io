I just went to CNN.com and [this](http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/09/12/saddam.trial.ap/index.html) caught my eye:

> _Hussein listened silently to the witness. But he lost his temper when one of the lawyers described Kurdish guerrillas, known here as peshmargas, as freedom fighters.</p> 
> 
> &#8220;You are agents of Iran and Zionism. **We will crush your heads**,&#8221; Hussein shouted.</em></blockquote>The story does not report whether Saddam was squinting through his pinched-together thumb and index finger when he made this threat.
