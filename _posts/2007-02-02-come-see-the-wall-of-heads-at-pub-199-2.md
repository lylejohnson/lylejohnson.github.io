On Tuesday night, we took the hotel desk clerk&#8217;s advice and had dinner at [Pub 199](http://local.yahoo.com/details?id=10850346) in Mt. Arlington, NJ. Calling it a &#8220;pub&#8221; is misleading, or maybe &#8220;pub&#8221; just means something different up north, but it was a pretty big place. The walls of the dining room were covered with all sorts of (dead and stuffed) critters. Sorry for the crappy picture quality, but all I had with me was the camera in my phone.

The food was good and reasonably priced. (I had the deluxe cheeseburger with fries, which I believe cost $7.00). One important thing to note is that they don&#8217;t take credit cards &#8212; cash only.
