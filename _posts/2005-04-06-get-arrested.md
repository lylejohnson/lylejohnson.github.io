Sometimes, you have to take a stand for the things that are really important in life. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m taking time out from the important work of this Web log to let you know about the campaign to save [&#8220;Arrested Development&#8221;](http://www.fox.com/arresteddev/), one of the funniest shows on TV right now.

Like a lot of great shows from years gone by, it&#8217;s won a number of awards but is nevertheless at risk of cancellation. In a promising move, however, FOX has recently launched the [&#8220;Get Arrested&#8221;](http://www.getarrested.com/) Web site to help promote the show and presumably get a feel for how many fans the show really has. I only recently found out about the show myself, and rented the first season on DVD to watch over a long weekend. If you&#8217;ve never seen the show, that&#8217;s probably the best way to get introduced to the characters and a lot of the background for what&#8217;s currently going on in the show (which is now wrapping up its second season). If you&#8217;re already a fan, take a minute to visit the [Web site](http://www.getarrested.com/) and take the Arrested Development Loyalty Oath.
