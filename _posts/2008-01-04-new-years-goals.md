I&#8217;m not going to call them resolutions, because that implies a bit too much of a commitment, but I&#8217;ve been thinking about some of the techie goals that I have for this year.

First, the obvious one. My goal (and my publisher&#8217;s &#8220;goal&#8221;, if you want to call it that) is to get [the book](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fxruby) finished. And we&#8217;re well on our way to accomplishing that.

Next, I want to learn a new programming language this year. Although I&#8217;m taking a look at [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/), I received <cite><a href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/jaerlang">Programming Erlang</a></cite> for Christmas (because my wife is just that good) and I&#8217;m liking what I&#8217;ve read about [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/) so far. I have the feeling that it&#8217;s going to win out. Scala reminds me a little too much of Java.

Lastly, I want to learn a lot more about developing applications for Mac OS X. That will no doubt involve my learning some [Objective C](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) along the way, but that&#8217;s not a bad thing. I&#8217;m especially eager to dig into the [RubyCocoa](http://rubycocoa.sourceforge.net/HomePage) framework that shipped with [Leopard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/), to see how viable a platform that is for developing and shipping commercial Mac OS X applications.

What about you? What are some of the technologies that you think you&#8217;ll be checking out in 2008?
