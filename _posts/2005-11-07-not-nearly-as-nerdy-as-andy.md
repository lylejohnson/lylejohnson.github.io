Andy Hunt [blogged](http://toolshed.com/blog/articles/2005/11/07/your-nerd-score) about his nerd score and so I naturally had to take the test to see where I stand: [![I am nerdier than 76% of all people. Are you nerdier? Click here to find out!](http://www.nerdtests.com/images/ft/nq.php?val=8729)](http://www.nerdtests.com/ft_nq.php?im)I&#8217;m still trying to decide whether I&#8217;m relieved to be only a mid-level nerd, or disappointed that I didn&#8217;t score higher.
