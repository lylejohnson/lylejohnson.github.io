Paul at Rogue Amoeba has [posted](http://www.rogueamoeba.com/utm/posts/Article/appleTV-2007-03-22-21-30) about his discovery that [AppleTV](http://www.apple.com/appletv/) will work just fine with some standard definition (i.e. non-HDTV) televisions, as long as they provide component video inputs and a simulated widescreen display mode.

My television definitely has component inputs, but I don&#8217;t know whether it has a &#8220;simulated widescreen&#8221; display mode. The owner&#8217;s manual doesn&#8217;t mention it, but the article&#8217;s author writes that his owner&#8217;s manual didn&#8217;t mention it either (despite the fact that his television apparently does have said mode). So now I&#8217;m thinking about picking up one to try out. I&#8217;m not uninterested in buying an HDTV, but we have a furniture problem that makes that an undesirable choice right now. Our &#8220;entertainment center,&#8221; which weighs approximately 4000 pounds and will never again move from the spot where it&#8217;s now sitting, has a 34 inch-wide space in which to put a television. That means the largest HDTV that would realistically fit would be one of the smallest available models (a 27&#8243; screen), and I&#8217;m guessing that that just wouldn&#8217;t be worth bothering with.

I&#8217;m in the camp that wishes that Apple had added DVR capabilities to this device, but I think I understand where they&#8217;re coming from business-wise &#8212; Apple wants to be your content provider, and they want you purchasing (or at least downloading) your content from the iTunes Music Store. If I decide not to try out Apple TV &#8212; say, because Denise won&#8217;t let me get one &#8212; I am still interested in converting our old PC to a [MythTV](http://www.mythtv.org/) server; and that might turn out to be the best option in the long run anyways.
