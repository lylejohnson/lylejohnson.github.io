I somehow missed _Eleanor Rigby_ when it was first published, which is unfortunate because it meant that the last two Douglas Coupland novels I read were _Hey, Nostradamus!_ (published just prior to _Eleanor Rigby_) and _JPod_ (published a couple of years after). I didn&#8217;t enjoy either one very much, and I was worried that Mr. Coupland had lost whatever it was that I liked about his writing. I just didn&#8217;t care about the characters in either of those books, like I had cared about Daniel and his friends from _Microserfs_, or the characters in _Girlfriend in a Coma_ (whose names I can&#8217;t recall at the moment,) or even the bizarre cast of _All Families Are Psychotic_ (bless their hearts!).

This book is about Liz Dunn, a lady who&#8217;s lonely, overweight and more or less resigned to a nothing-special kind of life. Things start to change for Liz when Jeremy, the son she placed for adoption when she was a teenager, unexpectedly re-enters her life as an adult. To tell you much more than that would ruin the surprise for you, and after all, this is a mini-review so I&#8217;m honor-bound to keep things brief. Suffice it to say that it&#8217;s an easy and enjoyable read, and one I&#8217;d recommend to someone who hasn&#8217;t read any of Douglas Coupland&#8217;s novels before. So there, go read it.
