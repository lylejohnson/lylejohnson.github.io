People seem to be comparing the newly-launched [Google Notebook](http://www.google.com/notebook/) to [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/), but it seems that a better comparison would be to sites like [Clipmarks](http://www.clipmarks.com/), or perhaps 37signals&#8217; [Backpack](http://www.backpackit.com/).

A lot of the criticism of Notebook focuses on the fact that (so far) it doesn&#8217;t support tagging of clippings. You can maintain multiple notebooks, and when you &#8220;note&#8221; something you assign it to one of those notebooks; but a clipping can&#8217;t belong to more than one notebook (or category) at the same time. I&#8217;m not sure that that&#8217;s a showstopper for me, when I think about how I&#8217;m likely to use Notebook. It is true that for [my del.icio.us bookmarks](http://del.icio.us/lyle), I typically assign multiple tags to a bookmark, and I rely on those tags to help me &#8220;find&#8221; links that I&#8217;ve tucked away. With Notebook, however, I&#8217;ll have access to Google&#8217;s search technology to search in my notebooks, and I anticipate that I&#8217;ll be able to find the clipping that I&#8217;m looking for at least as quickly as I would have using tags.

Another problem with Notebook is that there&#8217;s no mechanism for providing a &#8220;feed&#8221; of your notebook for others to subscribe to. I&#8217;m guessing that this shortcoming will be addressed by Google in short order, and again, it&#8217;s not really a showstopper for me.

So have you tried Notebook yet? What are your impressions?
