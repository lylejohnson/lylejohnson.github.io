I remember checking out [Dan Brickley](http://danbri.org/)&#8216;s [RubyRDF](http://raa.ruby-lang.org/list.rhtml?name=RubyRDF) library awhile back and having trouble doing much with it. But of course that was a long time ago, so I thought I&#8217;d check back in to see if any progress had been made. After all, it&#8217;s _that_ Dan Brickley, so you&#8217;ve at least got to see what&#8217;s there.

Unfortunately, the software was last updated in April 2003, and I suspect this means that it&#8217;s been abandoned. As noted in the [documentation](http://esw.w3.org/topic/RubyRdf), RubyRDF is an experimental system and &#8220;not production-grade stuff.&#8221; Dan also notes later in the page, &#8220;I might not do any more work on this.&#8221; That&#8217;s fair, of course; it seems clear that Dan was pursuing this to scratch an itch, as is the case for a lot of open source projects on the web. But I decided to set this one aside again after a scan of the still-cluttered Wiki page. I guess I&#8217;ll check again this time next year, if none of the other RDF libraries for Ruby make it that far.
