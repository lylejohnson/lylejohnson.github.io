Well, my luck with the new MacBook began to run out a little over a week ago, now. I wasn&#8217;t quite experiencing the [&#8220;random&#8221; shutdown problem](http://www.macbookrandomshutdown.com/) that a lot of MacBook owners are seeing, but my MacBook would shut down without warning when it was running off of battery power and the battery life fell too low. I tried recalibrating my battery, and resetting the Power Management Unit, but sometime last night the battery finally gave up the ghost. When I plugged the MacBook in this morning, it could no longer recharge the battery &#8212; there was a big ugly &#8220;X&#8221; there on the screen for the battery indicator.

So I dropped the MacBook off at [my local store](http://www.macresource-al.com/), and described the problem. They shouldn&#8217;t need to send it off to be repaired, but we&#8217;ll at least have to wait for a new battery to arrive. I hope that that&#8217;s all that it is.
