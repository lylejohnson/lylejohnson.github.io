My latest travel experience has convinced me that I need to invest in a good set of noise-cancelling headphones. I couldn&#8217;t turn up my iPod&#8217;s volume loud enough to drown out the voices of those two people sitting behind me on the two-and-a-half hour flight from Colorado Springs to Atlanta. It&#8217;s not that they were talking all that loudly, they just had those nasally voices operating at just the right frequency to pierce glass.

I knew that for a small fortune I could probably get some Bose headphones that would do a fine job, but I was hoping to find a compromise that would work almost as well. As it turned out, Googling for &#8220;[noise cancelling headphones](http://www.google.com/search?q=noise+cancelling+headphones "Google Search Results")&#8221; led me to a recent [review](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/14/technology/14pogue.html?ex=1342584000&en=4dd1aedadecc9ce5&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink "Headphones to Shut Out the World") (by David Pogue) of some notable alternatives. The problem is that, so far, I can&#8217;t find two of his top picks in any local stores. There&#8217;s no hint on the [Audio-Technica web site](http://www.audio-technica.com/ "Audio-Technica Web Site") about where you can find their [ATH-ANC7 headphones](http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/headphones/f9450db308d97785/index.html "Product page for ATH-ANC7 headphones") in stores, and it&#8217;s not clear to me that the [Panasonic RP-HC500](http://www2.panasonic.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/vModelDetail?storeId=15001&catalogId=13401&itemId=113542&catGroupId=25107&modelNo=&cacheProgram=11002&cachePartner=7000000000000005702 "Panasonic RP-HC500 Product Page") headphones are even being made anymore.

I could order either of these off of Amazon.com (or some other online dealer), but I really want to try them out in person first. I have a history with headphones not fitting me very well.
