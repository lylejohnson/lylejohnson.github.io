The book, [<cite>FXRuby: Create Lean and Mean GUIs with Ruby</cite>](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fxruby), is finally done! Thanks very much to all of the reviewers and Beta book readers who gave me such great and helpful feedback over the last few months. Print copies of the book should begin shipping soon. I&#8217;m expecting to receive my own copy in the mail any day now.

Last week my editor, Susannah Pfalzer, interviewed me about the book for the Pragmatic Programmers&#8217; [podcast series](http://pragprog.com/podcasts/), and that podcast has just [dropped](http://pragprog.com/podcasts/show/10). If you&#8217;ve been holding off on buying the book, some of the things that Susannah and I talk about in the podcast may help you to understand a bit better about what the book covers.
