The next meeting of the newly-formed [Huntsville Functional Programming Group](http://groups.google.com/group/huntfunc) (HuntFunc, for short) will be held Tuesday, December 7, starting at 11:00 a.m. at [the 347](http://the347.org/). The plan is for Joe Kutner to give a presentation comparing the concurrency features in various functional programming languages (Clojure, Erlang and Scala).

If you&#8217;re interested in meeting with fellow software developers to learn more about functional programming languages, how to think about them and use them in your own work, please come join us! We have folks of all experience levels and all are welcome, whether you&#8217;re new to FP or have been doing it for years.
