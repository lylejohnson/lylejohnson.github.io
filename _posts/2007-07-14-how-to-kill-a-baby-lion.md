[This](http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-talk-google/browse_thread/thread/253f91456dde8b75) may just be the most precious discussion ever held on the ruby-talk mailing list. It started out innocently enough: 

> Hey yall experienced coders and programmer dudes. I wanna make an MMORPG type game, but I have no programming experiance whatsoever.

He was advised to check out some great introductory programming books, like Chris Pine&#8217;s [<cite>Learn to Program</cite>](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/fr_ltp/). When he responded with the classic cheapskate/lazyweb plea&#8230;

> I sorta have no money to use on books and the like. I was hoping I could avoid buying anything by consulting the greater population of Ruby programmers.
&#8230; I knew that the discussion was going to have an unhappy ending. But I had no idea how entertaining the downward spiral would be. I don&#8217;t want to ruin it for you, but after being given pointers to free online learning resources, and being told repeatedly that he&#8217;d need to learn to walk before he could learn to run and learn at least the _basics_ of computer programming, well &#8212; things got a little testy.

> I will use my google skills now, TO FIND BETTER HELP. All of these tips were agravating, annoying, useless, telling me what I did wrong, telling me to do stupid stuff like that hellish Hello World crap, or all of the above. Not to mention, im going straight to dam C++. I have a better chance if I tackle the lion with my sword and shield rather than wait until the lion is hungry and attack it with the knoledge how to kill a baby lion. If you don&#8217;t get the anology, your not as smart as you think you are.

If you don&#8217;t have time to read it all, just stick to his posts. Great stuff.
