A little over a month ago, Paul Graham stirred up a little hornet&#8217;s nest with his essay [&#8220;Microsoft is Dead&#8221;](http://www.paulgraham.com/microsoft.html "Microsoft is Dead"). As he found it necessary to [clarify](http://www.paulgraham.com/cliffsnotes.html "Microsoft is Dead: The Cliffs Notes") a couple of days later, Paul didn&#8217;t mean to suggest that Microsoft was on the verge of going out of business. He meant that, in terms of all the progressive and exciting things going on in software development today, Microsoft is largely irrelevant. They continue to bolt on new features to Windows and Office in a desperate attempt to keep up with the competition, but it&#8217;s been a long time since anyone other than Microsoft&#8217;s marketing department considered them &#8220;innovative&#8221;.

Given this reality, today&#8217;s [news](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/index.htm?section=money_latest "Microsoft Takes On the Free World") that Microsoft is demanding royalty payments, for what it claims are over 200 patent violations by a number of open source projects (including [Linux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux "Linux article from Wikipedia") and [Open Office](http://www.openoffice.org/ "OpenOffice.org Home Page")), should come as no surprise. Although it&#8217;s not quite the same circumstances, I can&#8217;t help but compare this to the embarrassing efforts by the [SCO Group](http://www.linux.org/news/sco/index.html "SCO Controversy") over the past four years to claim intellectual property rights to parts of the Linux kernel (while their plummeting stock price continually threatens to get them [delisted](http://www.heraldextra.com/content/view/219959/3/ "SCO faces delisting from Nasdaq again") by Nasdaq). As [Charles Nutter](http://headius.blogspot.com/2007/05/big-plans.html "Big Plans") put it, &#8220;I&#8217;d hate to be an OSS (Open Source Software) developer or apologist [working] at Microsoft today.&#8221;
