Whenever Denise is out of town I have a mini-film festival, where I rent and watch the movies that she has no interest in seeing. Past entries include &#8220;Kill Bill&#8221; and &#8220;Mystic River&#8221;, for example.

Last night&#8217;s screening was [&#8220;Napoleon Dynamite&#8221;](http://imdb.com/title/tt0374900/), which is one of those stupidly funny movies that&#8217;s destined to become a cult classic. Unless you just take yourself much, much too seriously, you will probably laugh out loud at least a few times, and isn&#8217;t that worth the four bucks it will cost you to rent this one? On tap for tonight is [&#8220;Hero&#8221;](http://imdb.com/title/tt0299977/?fr=c2l0ZT1kZnxteD0yMHxzZz0xfGxtPTIwMHx0dD1vbnxwbj0wfHE9aGVyb3xodG1sPTF8bm09b24_;fc=1;ft=20;fm=1), unless of course I decide to watch Napoleon one more time.
