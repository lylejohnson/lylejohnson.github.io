[The Ridiculous Business Jargon Dictionary](http://www.theofficelife.com/business-jargon-dictionary-A.html) is a sort-of [Urban Dictionary](http://urbandictionary.com/) for the workplace. I&#8217;ve heard a lot of these before, but some are new to me, e.g. 

> **Malicious Obedience** [n.] _The act of following a boss&#8217;s instructions explicitly, while hoping for failure. It can also involve remaining quiet about any poor judgement or discovered mistakes._
