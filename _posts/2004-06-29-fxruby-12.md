Stayed up way too late last night, but I finally got a first alpha release of [FXRuby](http://www.fxruby.org) 1.2 out the door. After testing the waters on the mailing list, I decided to go ahead with my plan to switch to a [RubyGems](http://rubygems.rubyforge.org)-based distribution of the code. It took some work to make this transition, and I&#8217;m still not sure that the gems are quite right, but it feels like the right decision for the long term. I finally got the files released to [SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net), tagged it in CVS and then sent out the e-mail announcement to the FXRuby mailing lists.

As Murphy&#8217;s Law would have it, the SourceForge mailing list services went down around that time and so no one has actually _seen_ those announcements yet.
