Apparently [David Heinemeier Hansson](http://www.loudthinking.com/) will settle for nothing less than world domination. With the [launch](http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000396.html) of [Ta-da List](http://www.tadalist.com/), he&#8217;s sprung yet another [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.com/)-based application on the world. I only just got around to looking at [Flickr](http://flickr.com/) (<strike>also based on Rails, methinks</strike>) this past weekend and here comes a new toy to play with.

At first it wasn&#8217;t clear to me how (or if) Ta-da List is significantly different from [43 Things](http://43things.com/), a different Rails-based web site that I&#8217;ve written about earlier. Ta-da List is a subset of [Basecamp](http://www.basecamphq.com/), the project management system from [37signals](http://37signals.com/), and it&#8217;s clear from the web site that a significant motivation behind providing Ta-da List as a free service is to advertise for the more powerful capabilities found in Basecamp.

After a little more investigation, however, it looks like Ta-da List is simply an application for maintaining lists of things. Not that that&#8217;s a bad thing: it&#8217;s just different from what I see in 43 Things, which is more of a platform for social networking. With Ta-da List, you can maintain more than one list (e.g. &#8220;Things to do today&#8221;, &#8220;Books to read&#8221;, &#8220;People to kill&#8221;) and a given list can be publicly shared (viewable by all), privately shared (viewable and editable only by invitation) or a combination of the two (anyone can see it; only you and designated others can edit it). There are of course some nice touches that you appreciate but don&#8217;t always expect, like per-list RSS feeds.

I have the feeling that I&#8217;ll come to really like this service for the same reason that I like [del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us/). Putting the &#8220;social&#8221; aspect of del.icio.us aside, it finally gives me a way to access my bookmarks from any computer I&#8217;m sitting in front of; no more of this maintaining one set of bookmarks in Firefox at work, but a different set of bookmarks in Safari at home. In the same way, I think Ta-da List has the same potential to help me keep all of my little lists no further away than the nearest Internet connection, which would be swell since I never did get the PDA bug like so many of my friends and co-workers have.
