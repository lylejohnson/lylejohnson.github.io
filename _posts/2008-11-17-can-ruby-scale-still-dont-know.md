Thursday morning, first day of RubyConf. Matz has finished his keynote address and a check of my watch tells me that I&#8217;ve got some time to kill before Gregg Pollack&#8217;s talk on &#8220;Scaling Rails&#8221; starts at 10:25, so I head up to my hotel room for a bit. Unfortunately, when I returned to the conference room around 10:20, I found that Gregg had already begun his presentation to a standing-room-only audience. I wasn&#8217;t surprised that the room had filled up. Gregg is known to be a great presenter, and the topic is one of interest to most Rubyists these days.

As much as I was looking forward to seeing his talk, I&#8217;m not a big fan of standing in one place for 30 or 45 minutes, even if I have a wall to lean against, so I headed next door to sit in on David Koontz&#8217;s talk on [Monkeybars](http://monkeybars.rubyforge.org/). No problem, I figured, because the [Confreaks](http://confreaks.com/) guys were there recording all of the talks, and the video of Gregg&#8217;s talk would be up on their web site at some point after the conference ended. As David Black had noted in a conversation the night before, the fact that you can just catch videos of any of the talks you might have missed has quelled his concerns about RubyConf evolving from a single-track conference to one with multiple tracks.

Fast-forward to this morning, and I&#8217;m reading Peter Cooper&#8217;s [review](http://www.rubyinside.com/scaling-ruby-the-informative-40-minute-screencast-1337.html) of one of the latest [RailsEnvy](http://www.railsenvy.com/) screencasts, entitled (wait for it) &#8220;Scaling Ruby&#8221;. It is a 40-minute long, highly polished version of the presentation that Gregg gave at RubyConf, and it sells for $9. And I think this is great. Gregg and Jason provide a ton of absolutely free material to the Ruby and Rails community, including their popular weekly RailsEnvy podcasts. I&#8217;m sure that a lot of work went into producing the video, as well as the PDF that comes with it, and it is probably a great value for anyone who&#8217;s interested in purchasing it.

The thing that I _didn&#8217;t_ realize until I got to the review&#8217;s comments section, however, is that Gregg apparently chose not to have his RubyConf presentation recorded. I didn&#8217;t even realize that this was an option, probably because it&#8217;s an option that no other RubyConf presenter has ever exercised. Jeremy McAnally, organizer of this year&#8217;s [Ruby Hoedown](http://rubyhoedown.com/), also [indicated](http://twitter.com/jeremymcanally/status/1009810803) that Gregg didn&#8217;t want his Hoedown talk recorded either. Bottom line: If you (like me) missed his talk at RubyConf this year, you&#8217;re not going to see it.

Gregg did chime in with [his response](http://www.rubyinside.com/scaling-ruby-the-informative-40-minute-screencast-1337.html#comment-37371) to some of the negative comments on the review, and you can (and should) read those to hear his side of the story. His defense is that he put a lot of time into preparing for his presentation, and that he deserves to be compensated for that, and that if a free Confreaks recording of the same material were available that no one would buy the screencast. All of those things are probably true. (He does neglect to mention that the $250 conference registration fee is waived for presenters; perhaps he also chose to pay that fee in lieu of having his talk recorded.)

Let me be clear that while it is quite possibly a serious PR blunder on his part, Gregg didn&#8217;t break any &#8220;rules&#8221; and hasn&#8217;t done anything unethical per se. There&#8217;s also nothing on the [RubyConf site](http://www.rubyconf.org/), or in the conference materials, that guarantees video of each and every conference presentation will eventually be available on the Confreaks site. And before someone accuses me of being a free software zealot who believes that &#8220;information wants to be free&#8221;, let me reiterate that I&#8217;m not opposed to folks [charging money](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fxruby/fxruby) for their work. Baby needs new shoes and all that. I would simply request that in the future RubyConf organizers consider requiring conference speakers to agree to have their talks recorded; or, barring that, <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">being a little more up-front</span>Â somehow communicating with conference attendees about _which_ conference presentations are truly &#8220;can&#8217;t miss&#8221;.
