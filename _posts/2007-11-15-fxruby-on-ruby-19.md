After a relatively small number of changes required to the code, FXRuby is now working on the trunk version of Ruby 1.9.0. These fixes will be available in the next release of FXRuby. I&#8217;ve only played around with some of the example programs so far, and certainly haven&#8217;t tried to do any benchmarking, but I can tell you that it <span style="font-style: italic">feels</span> a lot faster. Ruby&#8217;s poor performance has often made it a hard sell in certain environments and for certain kinds of applications; based on what I&#8217;ve seen so far, the new VM implementation for Ruby 1.9 is really going to change things!
