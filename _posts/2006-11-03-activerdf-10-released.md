Benjamin Heitmann and Eyal Oren have just announced the 1.0 release of [ActiveRDF](http://www.activerdf.org/): 

> _ActiveRDF is a library for accessing RDF data from Ruby programs. ActiveRDF gives you a domain specific language for your RDF model and provides object-oriented access to your RDF resources, classes, properties, etc. ActiveRDF conforms to the RDFS specification (multiple inheritance, multiple class membership, etc.)</p> 
> 
> ActiveRDF can be used as data layer in Ruby-on-Rails, similar to ActiveRecord. ActiveRDF with Ruby-on-Rails puts the semantic web on rails, and allows you to create semantic web applications rapidly.
> 
> With ActiveRDF you can access various sources of RDF data. We support SPARQL endpoints, Redland and RDFLite; (native) adapters for Jena, Sesame2 and YARS are in development.</em></blockquote>
> 
> I played around with some of the earlier releases of ActiveRDF, and while it definitely had some rough edges, I liked the idea and am anxious to see how well it&#8217;s working now.
