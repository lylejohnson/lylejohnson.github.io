In his [latest essay](http://www.paulgraham.com/pypar.html), Paul Graham comments on what he refers to as the &#8220;Python Paradox&#8221;:

> _&#8220;&#8230; if a company chooses to write its software in a comparatively esoteric language, they&#8217;ll be able to hire better programmers, because they&#8217;ll attract only those who cared enough to learn it.&#8221;_The essay&#8217;s not a Python love-fest, by the way; he also acknowledges a number of other underdogs, including [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org).

For a few years now I&#8217;ve made a point of highlighting my Ruby programming skills on my resume, but it never generated any real interest; at least, not any more interest than, say, listing completely unrelated hobbies would have. So I was pleasantly surprised when I was asked about it during some of the technical interviews for my current job. No, it&#8217;s not a Ruby job; we&#8217;re working in Java pretty exclusively. But it&#8217;s nice to believe that my interest in Ruby may have had some influence on their decision to hire me.
