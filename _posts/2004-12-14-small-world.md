While clicking through some of the links attached to [this Slashdot story](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/12/14/1732238&tid=95&tid=133), I landed on the [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) entry for [Jimmy Wales](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jimmy_Wales), one of the co-founders of Wikipedia. I was surprised to learn that Jimmy was born in Huntsville, Alabama (where I live and work) and is a graduate of Auburn University (my alma mater).
