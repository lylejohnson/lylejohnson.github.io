It has occurred to me more than once in the recent past that it would be neat to have a service like [Instapaper](http://www.instapaper.com/), but for videos. A post appeared on Hacker News today announcing [Instafilm](http://www.instafilm.com/), which seems poised to fit the bill after the site becomes more stable (I&#8217;m getting a lot of errors at the moment, probably due to server overload). In the [comments section](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2488142) of the HN post, however, a number of alternative sites were mentioned, including:

  * [Instafilm](http://www.instafilm.com/)
  * [VHX](http://vhx.tv/), which is still in a closed beta
  * [Squrl](http://www.squrl.com/)
  * [Wacchen](http://wacchen.com/)
  * [Rewindle](http://rewindle.com/)
  * [Reeplay.it](http://reeplay.it/), also currently in a private beta
  * [Lideo](http://www.lideo.me/)

They all appear to be free, at least for the basic service. Some of them, like Squrl, also have companion iPhone/iPad apps. Are there any others you&#8217;re aware of? Let me know in the comments!
