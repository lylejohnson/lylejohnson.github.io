I really need to start carrying a digital camera around with me, or at least learn how to download pictures from my cell phone to my computer. For example, if I had been more prepared, I could have captured for you an image of the sign outside the _Billiard Street Cafe_, advertising their upcoming &#8220;Huntsville Hottys&#8221; competition. ( I didn&#8217;t stop to inform them that the proper spelling would be &#8220;Hotties.&#8221;)

But I am specifically thinking of a sign we saw on the side of the road on Highway 280, down near my in-laws&#8217; house in Sterrett. It was a small white sign, low to the ground, and the sign-maker had used black spray paint against a stencil to apply the ominous message: &#8220;KNIVES AHEAD.&#8221; Man, I wish I&#8217;d taken a picture.
