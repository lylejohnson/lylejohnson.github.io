Yesterday (was it just yesterday?) Google announced the beta release of [Google Talk](http://www.google.com/talk/), their instant messaging service. Actually, there&#8217;s more to it than just IM; it also does Voice over IP (VoIP), which I&#8217;ve been meaning to look into for a while now.

I&#8217;m trying to get excited about this. I&#8217;m a fan of Google and especially some of their other services (like [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com/) and [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com/)). But for some reason, I never got into the IM habit, and as far as I know, none of my friends are really into it either. Is this a generational thing? It seems like its mostly younger people (where I of course define &#8220;young&#8221; as &#8220;under the age of 30&#8243;) who are really leading the way on this.
