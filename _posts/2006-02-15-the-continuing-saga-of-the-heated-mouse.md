So this is weird.

Back in late November or early December of last year, Denise mentioned that she wished someone would invent a heated mouse. Sure enough, Googling for the phrase [&#8220;heated mouse&#8221;](http://www.google.com/search?q=heated+mouse) turned up several blog articles referencing a [company](http://www.theheatedmouse.com/) that claimed to produce just the item she was looking for. Never one to look an obvious Christmas gift idea in the mouth, I placed an order. I was a little troubled by the ordering process, which required me to make payment using PayPal, but I went along with it because other people seemed to having orders filled with no troubles.

I placed the order on December 10, and after a few days I sent in an e-mail inquiry to ask when the item would actually be shipped. I received a quick reply that assured me (in ALL CAPS, no less) that I&#8217;d get it on or before December 24. Great!

Well, Christmas came and went with no sign of the heated mouse. Subsequent e-mails and phone calls to the seller went unanswered. I finally filed a complaint with PayPal around January 10, but they were unable to do anything about it. (Thanks, PayPal!) I chalked it up to a $59.99 life lesson and moved on.

Hearing about someone else&#8217;s recent troubles with a sale through PayPal reminded me of my problem, so I once again Googled to see if anyone has reported problems similar to mine. I was surprised to find new comments on [one of the blog articles](http://blog.centresource.com/2005/10/24/the-heated-mouse/) I&#8217;d seen last year, in which other shafted customers were complaining about non-delivery of their heated mice. Most surprising, however, was a comment allegedly from the fellow who was actually selling the mouse: 

> _Ladies and Gentleman. I am Rudy Hinojosa, creator of the heated mouse. I want to publicly express my apologies for not being able to process your orders in a timely fashion. My manufacturer deal did not go through. I’m being forced to make them once again by hand. This is so frustrating. I have about 60 back orders in queue. I have stopped new orders alltogether. I will be providing refunds for those who request it. My contact information is still the same. I’m working overtime to get these orders out._ &#8220;Rudy&#8221; neglects to mention why he never replied to any of his customers&#8217; e-mails or phone calls; I&#8217;m not optimistic that I&#8217;ll actually get a response if I try to contact him about a refund. But I suppose it won&#8217;t hurt to try. Stay tuned.
