I started listening to Garrison Keillor&#8217;s [A Prairie Home Companion](http://prairiehome.publicradio.org/) when I was kid, and still try catch at least part of the show on the radio every weekend. I&#8217;ve read several of his books, and the show&#8217;s even on my list of [43 Things](http://www.43things.com/person/lyle) to do some day.

So I was disappointed to [read](http://www.mnspeak.com/mnspeak/archive/post-733.cfm) this afternoon about a lawsuit that Keillor&#8217;s brought against a blogger for a t-shirt that parodies his show. When you consider the show&#8217;s tradition of poking lighthearted fun at people from all walks of life and political persuasions, Keillor&#8217;s reaction really just reinforces the stereotype of the humorless liberal. I&#8217;d like to believe that these are the actions of an overzealous lawyer, that Keillor&#8217;s not aware of how petty this makes him look, and that he&#8217;ll still take the opportunity to retract his cease and desist order against the blogger and his Web site, but it doesn&#8217;t sound like that&#8217;s going to happen.
