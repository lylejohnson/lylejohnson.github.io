[SCIgen](http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/scigen/) is an automatic Computer Science paper generator. If you&#8217;ve ever wanted to write a realistic looking, but ultimately nonsensical paper on a random Computer Science topic (with Mr. T as co-author, no less), now&#8217;s your chance. Be sure to read about how one of these randomly generated papers was submitted and accepted to a conference!
