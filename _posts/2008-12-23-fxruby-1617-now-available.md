Just in time for Christmas, a [new release](http://rubyforge.org/forum/forum.php?forum_id=29302) of [FXRuby](http://www.fxruby.org/). It&#8217;s been almost six months since the last release, which is way too long to go between releases (even when it&#8217;s just for minor bug fixes). A [summary of all the changes](http://www.fxruby.org/doc/changes.html) for this release can be found in the change log, but the most important change has to do with addressing some problems that were introduced when [Ruby&#8217;s garbage collection algorithm was changed](http://pivotallabs.com/users/brianj/blog/articles/606-standup-11-24-2008-changes-to-gc-in-ruby-1-8-6- "Changes to GC in Ruby 1.8.6?").
