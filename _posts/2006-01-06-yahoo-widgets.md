Yes, I know that Mac OS X Tiger users have had [Dashboard](http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/dashboard/) for a while now, but [this](http://widgets.yahoo.com/) looks pretty sweet to those of us stuck using Windows at work. I have yet to read about [Yahoo! Go](http://go.connect.yahoo.com/go) but it sounds promising, too.
