A word to the wise.

There&#8217;s some [anecdotal](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=453990) [evidence](http://groups.google.com/group/Gmail-Problem-solving/browse_thread/thread/097f9c7603f40dc1/684c127945f4ade3#684c127945f4ade3) that Google has recently modified the Spam filtering algorithm for Gmail. This afternoon, I checked the Spam folder for my primary e-mail account and discovered that over the past two days, six legitimate messages had been flagged as Spam. All but one of those were &#8220;bulk mail&#8221; messages, sent to mailing lists, but none of them were unsolicited. I&#8217;ve received similar messages (from the same senders) before without them getting flagged as Spam.

If you&#8217;re like me, you&#8217;ve come to rely so heavily on Gmail&#8217;s excellent Spam filtering that you just &#8220;set it and forget it&#8221;. For the time being, however, you might want to keep an eye on what&#8217;s ending up in your Spam folder&#8212;at least until the problem is corrected.
