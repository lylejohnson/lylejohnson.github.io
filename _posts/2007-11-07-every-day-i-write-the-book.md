Some of the handful of readers of this blog already know about this, but I can now officially announce that I&#8217;m writing a book about [FXRuby](http://www.fxruby.org/ "FXRuby Home Page") for the [Pragmatic Bookshelf](http://www.pragprog.com/). I&#8217;m excited about this project because it will be the first book ever dedicated to the subject of [FOX](http://www.fox-toolkit.org/ "FOX Home Page") and FXRuby application development. I&#8217;m especially excited to be writing for the Pragmatic Programmers, who over the past few years have set a new standard of excellence for software development books.

The working title for the book is [<cite>FXRuby: Create Lean and Mean GUIs with Ruby</cite>](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/FXRUBY "Book Page at Pragmatic Bookshelf"), and it will be published next April. The purpose of this book is to give you a head start on developing GUI applications with Ruby and FXRuby through a combination of tutorial exercises and focused technical information. It isn&#8217;t a comprehensive book on FXRuby programming, and it&#8217;s not a reference manual. What this book _will_ do is get you over the initial conceptual hurdles and equip you with the practical information that you need to build your own applications.

The book is intended for software developers who are already comfortable with Ruby programming and who want to learn how to develop GUI applications with Ruby. No prior experience with GUI development is needed, but it&#8217;s intended to be useful both to newcomers as well as those who have worked with other GUI toolkits in the past. As the book gets closer to completion, we will be looking for help from technical reviewers. Watch this space for updates!
