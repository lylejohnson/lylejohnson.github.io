Leo just [blogged](http://leobard.twoday.net/stories/535392/) about [A9.com](http://a9.com)&#8216;s new &#8220;Block View&#8221; feature for their Yellow Pages and so I just had to try it out.

On their [&#8220;How we did it&#8221;](http://www.a9.com/-/company/YellowPages.jsp) page they note that only a few major cities have been covered, but luckily for me, Atlanta&#8217;s one of them and I still remember a few things about Atlanta. I did a [search](http://a9.com/varsity%20restaurant) for &#8220;varsity restaurant&#8221; and it came back with a list of possible hits, of which [this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/yp/B0004C34C0/104-3627336-7840738?) seemed like the best. Alas, there&#8217;s no block view image for the world&#8217;s largest drive-in, so I tried again with a [search](http://a9.com/georgia%20tech) for &#8220;georgia tech&#8221; and landed [here](http://www.amazon.com/gp/yp/B0004CPMPC/104-3627336-7840738?). This entry does have a block view image associated with it; now, for the moment of truth.

I recognized from the picture that we&#8217;re standing at the corner of North Avenue and that exit ramp that comes off of I-85 South, so I started clicking the little &#8220;Walk Right&#8221; navigation arrows to &#8220;move&#8221; to the right. Sure enough, I&#8217;m walking up North Avenue towards the Varsity; and after a few more steps, the Varsity&#8217;s parking lot comes into view! I only wish I could look &#8220;up&#8221; at this point, since you can&#8217;t see the Varsity&#8217;s big marquee sign out front. (_If I walk a little further up the street, I can even see that the Subway restaurant at the corner of Spring Street is still there&#8230;_)

I&#8217;m not exactly sure how useful this will be, in practice. If you&#8217;re already familiar with the area and some of the surrounding landmarks, as I was when &#8220;looking&#8221; for the Varsity, I can see how it would help you pinpoint the location of a business and perhaps what its storefront looks like in context. I&#8217;m not sure it would be quite as useful to me if I were trying to locate a business in an unfamiliar place, however.

But still, it&#8217;s way cool, isn&#8217;t it?
