Tom Copeland from [RubyForge](http://rubyforge.org/) directs your attention to the latest [download statistics](http://rubyforge.org/project/stats/index.php?report=months&group_id=167) for the [One-Click Ruby Installer](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/) for Windows. Since Matz announced the Ruby 1.8.2 final release on December 25, 2004, and the final release of the one-click installer followed on January 1, 2005, it seems reasonable to assume that the 12,837 downloads during the month of January were all for that version. That&#8217;s more than twice the number of downloads during the month of December!
