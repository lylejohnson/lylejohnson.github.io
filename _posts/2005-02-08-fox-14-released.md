This morning Jeroen [announced](http://www.fox-toolkit.com/news.html) FOX version 1.4, the new stable release of that GUI toolkit. Work on this version of FOX began in May 2004, shortly after the release of FOX 1.2, so there&#8217;s a lot of good stuff in this release. A short list includes: 

  * Support for a number of new image file formats (such as the Amiga IFF and Sun Raster image formats).
  * Support for non-rectangular windows.
  * Improved support for multithreaded applications.
  * Several new widgets, including `FXSplashWindow`, `FXChoiceBox`, `FXDockSite`, `FX7Segment`, `FXToolBarDock` and `FXDockBar`.
  * Added support for editable table cells in the `FXTable` widget.
  * Lots of other bug fixes and minor enhancments. As this announcement caught me by surprise, there will be a bit of a delay before you see a &#8220;What&#8217;s New in FOX 1.4&#8243; document comparable to the one I did for 

[FOX 1.2](http://www.knology.net/~lyle/fox/1.2/WhatsNew.html). Likewise, it will be awhile before I can put together an [FXRuby](http://www.fxruby.org/) release that works with FOX 1.4. So stop asking!
