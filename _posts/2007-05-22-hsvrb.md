[Hsv.rb](http://groups.google.com/group/hsvrb?hl=en "Hsv.rb Home Page") is a users group for [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/ "Ruby Home Page") and [Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org/ "Rails Home Page") enthusiasts in the Huntsville, Alabama area. The group has just been formed, and we&#8217;re currently working on building up the online community before making any decisions about meeting locations or topics. If you&#8217;re a Rubyist anywhere in the North Alabama area, please join us. Thanks to Philip Reed for getting the ball rolling on this!
