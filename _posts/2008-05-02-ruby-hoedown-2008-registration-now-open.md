The 2nd annual [Ruby Hoedown](http://www.rubyhoedown.com/) will be held August 8-9, 2008, in Huntsville, Alabama. This is the southeast&#8217;s regional Ruby Conference, and the conference this year is hosted by [hsv.rb](http://groups.google.com/group/hsvrb) (the Huntsville area Ruby and Rails User Group) and sponsored by [Engine Yard](http://www.engineyard.com/). 

The keynote speakers for this year&#8217;s conference will be David A. Black and Chris Wanstrath. If you&#8217;re interested in speaking at the Hoedown, [proposals for presentations](http://www.rubyhoedown.com/cfp.html) will be accepted until June 2. There are approximately 5 slots for full-length presentations (no more than one hour in length, with an additional 10-20 minutes for questions afterwards). You&#8217;ll also be able to sign up on the day of the conference for one of the approximately 8 slots for lightning talks if that&#8217;s more your speed.

If you [register now](http://rubyhoedown.eventwax.com/ruby-hoedown-2008/register) you&#8217;ll pay only $149 (a savings of $50 off the standard registration fee). Last year&#8217;s conference in Raleigh was a blast, and I hope you&#8217;ll join us this summer in the Rocket City!
