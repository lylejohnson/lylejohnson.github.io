[Semitar](http://semitar.projects.semwebcentral.org) is an &#8220;almost pure&#8221; Ruby library for processing Semantic Web data in RDF and OWL. The &#8220;almost&#8221; qualification stems from the fact that it uses Redland&#8217;s [Raptor](http://www.redland.opensource.ac.uk/raptor) parser, instead of a pure Ruby RDF parser, in the interest of performance. Semitar is being developed by Rich Kilmer and Chad Fowler, two well-known contributors to the Ruby community.

Also found [this link](http://www.daml.org/meetings/2004/05/pi/pdf/InfoEther-Semitar.pdf) to the PDF&#8217;d version of a PowerPoint presentation on Semitar. It&#8217;s unclear which parts of Semitar have actually been implemented and which ones are still in the planning stages.

As with the previous post on RDF-Redland, this one&#8217;s short on content for now. Can you tell that I&#8217;m trying to push out a lot of draft articles that I&#8217;ve had sitting in the queue for while? Expect more information about my adventures with Semitar as we get closer and closer to [RubyConf](http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/).
