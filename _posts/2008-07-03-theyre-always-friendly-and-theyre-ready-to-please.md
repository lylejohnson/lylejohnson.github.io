I periodically use Google&#8217;s [Blog Search](http://blogsearch.google.com "Google Blog Search") tool to look for references to [FXRuby](http://www.fxruby.org/ "FXRuby Home Page"), and today&#8217;s search turned up a couple of [recent](http://redworld.blog.ubuntu.org.cn/2008/07/01/fxruby%e5%88%9d%e4%bd%93%e9%aa%8cpart1/) [posts](http://redworld.blog.ubuntu.org.cn/2008/07/01/fxruby%e5%88%9d%e4%bd%93%e9%aa%8cpart2/) on a Chinese language blog. Curious to know what it was that this blogger was writing, and me not being able to read Chinese, I ran the pages through Google&#8217;s [Translate](http://translate.google.com/translate_t?hl=en "Google Translate") service to see if I could get some idea.

As is often the case with machine translation, the results were more humorous than enlightening. The closing line of the first entry translates as: 

> <span onmouseover="_tipon(this)" onmouseout="_tipoff()">Seems too long, put another log on the open bar.</span> And then there&#8217;s this gem from the second post: 

>  <span onmouseover="_tipon(this)" onmouseout="_tipoff()">The structure is so clear, I think if that is what MFC of the poor children who will have to see after that what the MFC threw it easy.</span> All joking aside, the good news is that someone in China is taking the time to blog about FXRuby, and about [the book](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fxruby) (maybe they even paid for it!). It&#8217;s gratifying to think that people in other countries are reading what I&#8217;ve written.
