I usually don&#8217;t notice these things, but [today&#8217;s IMDb Daily Poll question](http://imdb.com/poll/results/2007-02-07) caught my eye: 

> Who would win in a fight: [Abigail Breslin](http://imdb.com/name/nm1113550/) or [Dakota Fanning](http://imdb.com/name/nm0266824/)? For awhile I thought I was the only one who found Dakota Fanning annoying and &#8212; dare I say it? &#8212; a little creepy, but it seems like I&#8217;m seeing a lot of Dakota backlash lately. How did her managers manage to let things get this way? By the way, if you missed seeing Amy Poehler in the &#8220;Dakota Fanning Show&#8221; on SNL last week, catch it at [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AcNDzrfU0Ss).

P.S. I voted for Dakota. I mean, I loved _Little Miss Sunshine_, but if push came to shove I could see Dakota fighting dirty before Abigail.
