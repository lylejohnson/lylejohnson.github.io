Did you ever see that Saturday Night Live skit where James Bond is informed by his doctor that he has some kind of venereal disease, and he is counseled to contact everyone he&#8217;s ever slept with to make sure that they get tested?

I always wondered when we&#8217;d see that episode of [&#8220;Frasier&#8221;](http://www.nbc.com/Frasier/index.html).

I mean, you would occasionally hear complaints about the abundance of casual (and often careless) sex on _other_ prime-time shows (e.g. &#8220;Friends&#8221;) but I don&#8217;t recall anyone ever going after Frasier.

I admit that I haven&#8217;t been watching the show regularly for the last few seasons. For me, the show jumped around the time Niles and Daphne got together. Or maybe it was when they tried out Jean Smart as his love interest for a few episodes. Nevertheless, as I did with &#8220;Friends&#8221;, I suppose I will tune in tonight for the series finale. I do _like_ the character, and I won&#8217;t be at all surprised if they manage to spin off yet another series featuring Kelsey Grammer. It&#8217;s worked for Cosby and Newhart, after all.
