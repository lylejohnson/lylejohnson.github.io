Well, [Dan Berger](http://www.livejournal.com/users/djberg96/47251.html) has posted his short list of people he wants to talk to at the [Ruby Conference](http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/) next month and I have inexplicably been overlooked. I have therefore started a little list of my own, with the people I plan to snub next month: 

  1. Dan Berger Well, that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got so far.

It shouldn&#8217;t be hard to avoid him, what with the [expected 195 attendees](http://www.loudthinking.com/arc/000512.html) milling around. It&#8217;s a little surreal to imagine _that_ many people turning out for a Ruby Conference.

Back in 2001, barely a month after the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon, I drove my new Honda CR-V down to Tampa, Florida to attend the first-ever Ruby Conference. I was going to make a presentation on [FXRuby](http://www.fxruby.org/), a new GUI toolkit for Ruby. There were probably only about 40 people in attendance, which made for a very relaxed setting (in the best sense). Dave Thomas and Andy Hunt (the authors of _Programming Ruby_) were there, and meeting them was like meeting a couple of rock stars. I think that was the conference where Nathaniel Talbott gave a presentation on Lapidary, a unit testing framework for Ruby that eventually morphed into Test::Unit. Ryan Leavengood gave a presentation on a sort of packaging concept he called &#8220;Ruby Gems,&#8221; that petered out but was reborn a few years later at the 2003 Ruby Conference in Austin. Matz was there, and I think David Black, Chad Fowler, Avi Bryant, and some other folks I didn&#8217;t know but have gotten to know better over the last few years. It&#8217;s interesting to reflect on how much has changed since that time.

A side note: I also recall that in a separate conference room, across the hall from ours, a precious gems dealer had set up a table with his wares. I wondered if he had mistakenly assumed that the focus of our conference was the _other_ kind of ruby. <img src="http://lylejohnson.name/blog/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif" alt=";)" class="wp-smiley" />
