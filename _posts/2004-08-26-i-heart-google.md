Thanks to Google, I did track down that presentation of Andy&#8217;s I was looking for [here](http://www.rubyconf.com/2001/talks/insurgency/img0.htm). I need to ask [Chad](http://www.chadfowler.com) if he or one of the other conference organizers has a copy of the original [OpenOffice.org](http://www.openoffice.org) presentation, as opposed to this HTML dump of it; seeing [this slide](http://www.rubyconf.com/2001/talks/insurgency/img8.htm) in its pre-unfurled glory takes away from the drama that ensued during the live presentation, when Andy clicked to reveal the shark at the bottom of the page.
