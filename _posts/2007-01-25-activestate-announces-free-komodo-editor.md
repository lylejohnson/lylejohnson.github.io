[ActiveState](http://www.activestate.com/) has just [announced](http://www.activestate.com/Company/NewsRoom/Press/2007_01_23_0) the release of [Komodo Edit 4.0](http://www.activestate.com/products/komodo_edit/), a free editor based on their [Komodo IDE](http://www.activestate.com/products/komodo_ide/). I have been a little disappointed that ActiveState never chose to provide a commercially-supported version of Ruby (similar to their ActivePerl and ActivePython products), but I am glad that they added Ruby support to Komodo. David Ascher and his team at ActiveState are a really smart bunch of guys and I believe this is going to fill a significant gap in the Ruby development world (namely, the lack of a decent cross-platform IDE).

I&#8217;m still in the honeymoon phase with [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) and so I&#8217;m not really _looking_ for a new editor at the moment, but I&#8217;m going to download Komodo Edit anyways to take a look. Also note that Komodo Edit is available for Mac OS X, Linux and Windows.
