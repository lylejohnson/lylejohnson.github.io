So I signed up to establish a Web site for the Auburn Knights Alumni Association, and since the primary focus of that Web site will be to keep the membership up to date with the latest news about what other members are up to, I&#8217;m leaning towards using some kind of web log as the front end. There will be other areas of the Web site that provide more archival data (e.g. old issues of the newsletter), but the front page is definitely where all the action will be.

Since we don&#8217;t have a real firm plan about what kinds of things we&#8217;ll want to do with the site in the future, I&#8217;m going to start out with a cheap hosting solution (most likely [GoDaddy.com](http://godaddy.com)&#8216;s $3.95/month plan). As a matter of personal preference, I&#8217;m looking for a lightweight blogging solution that generates static pages that I can upload to the site. One such solution is the venerable [bloxsom](http://www.blosxom.com/), but to keep things in the [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) family I thought I&#8217;d try out [Hobix](http://hobix.com) first.

[Robert Brook](http://robertbrook.com/) is collecting some of the useful [tips](http://robertbrook.com/hobix/tips.html) that have appeared on the [Hobix](http://hobix.com) mailing list. Elsewhere, on [another](http://robertbrook.com/hobix.html) of his Hobix pages, Robert reminded me of some hobix [tutorials](http://sl33p3r.free.fr/hobix-tutorials/hobix-tutorials.html) that I saw awhile back when I first started looking at all things Hobix. One of those tutorials ([this one](http://sl33p3r.free.fr/hobix-tutorials/hobix-tut-2-en.html)) provides what is probably the only description known to man of how Hobix&#8217;s &#8220;quick&#8221; templates work, and why you might want to use them. Actually, _technically_, those secrets were revealed on the Hobix mailing list way back in September 2004, as I just discovered while wandering through the [mailing list archives](http://rubyforge.org/pipermail/hobix-is-the-way/); but you&#8217;d be hard-pressed to find them anywhere on the main Hobix Web site.
