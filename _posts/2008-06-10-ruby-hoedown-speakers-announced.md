Jeremy McAnally has just announced the talks that we&#8217;ll be seeing at this year&#8217;s [Ruby Hoedown](http://www.rubyhoedown.com/), and it&#8217;s a really great-looking lineup:

  * Giles Bowkett will be speaking about [Archaeopteryx](http://gilesbowkett.blogspot.com/2008/02/archaeopteryx-ruby-midi-generator.html), a Ruby-based system for auto-generating, self-modifying music. I&#8217;ve heard nothing but rave reviews of this project, which Giles has previously spoken about at GoRuCo and the MountainWest Ruby Conference.
  * Gregg Pollack and Jason Seifer (of [RailsEnvy](http://www.railsenvy.com/) blog and podcast fame) will be speaking about a number of the most useful, ingenious and innovative developments to come out of the Ruby community over the past year. If you saw Gregg and Jason in the [MVC Public Service Announcement videos](http://www.railsenvy.com/2008/6/3/mvc-videos) at RailsConf, you know that this is bound to be an entertaining presentation.
  * Rick Bradley will be speaking about the problem of transforming a Ruby application that doesn&#8217;t have any tests into one that&#8217;s well-spec&#8217;d and has good test coverage. I&#8217;m especially looking forward to hearing this talk!
  * Rein Henrichs is the author of an upcoming book on Ruby best practice patterns (inspired by Kent Beck&#8217;s <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Smalltalk-Best-Practice-Patterns-Kent/dp/013476904X">Smalltalk Best Practice Patterns</a></cite> book) and he&#8217;ll be speaking about that, with examples from the book.
  * Robert Dempsey will be speaking on how to employ Ruby in [&#8220;cloud computing&#8221;](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cloud_computing) applications, via services like Amazon.com&#8217;s [Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](http://aws.amazon.com/ec2/) and [Simple Storage Service (S3)](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). This is another talk that I&#8217;m looking forward to, given all of the recent development in this area.
  * Joe Kutner will be speaking about <a http="http://www.ruleby.org/">Ruleby</a>, a rule engine for Ruby. If you&#8217;ve never used a rule engine before, you may be surprised to learn how this declarative style of programming can complement the procedural Ruby code that you&#8217;re used to.
  * Finally, Troy Davis will take a look at different APIs you can use to develop Ruby applications that can interact with phone calls to varying degrees (via platforms like [Asterisk](http://www.asterisk.org/) and [FreeSWITCH](http://www.freeswitch.org/)).

In addition, we&#8217;ll have a Charity Tutorial Breakfast session during which Jim Weirich and Joe O&#8217;Brien will discuss the use of mock objects in testing. Sounds good, right? If you haven&#8217;t registered yet, [get to it](http://rubyhoedown.eventwax.com/ruby-hoedown-2008/register)! The [Hoedown](http://www.rubyhoedown.com/) will be held August 8 and 9 in Huntsville, Alabama. We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing you there!
