So, to distract myself from reading about all of the happy people playing with their new iPhones, I decided to spend this evening upgrading the RAM in my MacBook. Several of the applications that I use fairly regularly, like [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/), are known memory hogs. I had especially been having more and more trouble running Windows XP under [Parallels](http://www.parallels.com/), to the point that it would take 20-30 seconds just to launch a &#8220;Command&#8221; window (i.e. the DOS prompt). I already knew that Apple would charge me an arm and a leg if I bought RAM directly from them, so I shopped around at a couple of reputable online sellers. I settled on a [2Gb kit by Corsair](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.asp?Item=N82E16820233050), on sale for $84.99 (plus $4.99 for shipping and handling) from [Newegg.com](http://www.newegg.com/). All of the reviews for this one were really positive, and so I placed the order on Wednesday, it shipped from Memphis on Thursday, and I received it this evening.

I&#8217;ve installed a lot of memory in desktop computers over the years, but this is the first time that I&#8217;ve tried to install memory in a notebook computer. I&#8217;ll go ahead and warn you that it&#8217;s pretty difficult to get the SIMMs seated properly. My thumbs are really sore from pushing those suckers into the slots! After the first attempt, when I thought I had them seated well enough, the notebook just wouldn&#8217;t boot up. Luckily, the memory slots are fairly easy to get to &#8212; you just remove the battery and unscrew an L-bracket that covers the slots. On my second attempt, the memory was seated properly and the MacBook booted up just fine.

After the upgrade, everything seems snappier, and I&#8217;m confident now that it was a worthwhile investment. From the time I start the VM under Parallels, it takes just under fifteen seconds to &#8220;boot up&#8221; to the Windows login screen, and once I&#8217;m logged in, programs that should start up quickly do so. The Activity Monitor also reports that Parallels is using up a lot less CPU since it&#8217;s no longer having to swap out to disk so much. If you&#8217;re currently trying to run Parallels on a computer with 1Gb of RAM or less and it&#8217;s not working well for you, I can strongly recommend this upgrade.
