As the initial reviews from real-life iPhone owners began to trickle in, I started keeping a list of some of the problems they were reporting. Not the meta-problems that I already knew about, such as the fact that AT&T is the only supported carrier, or the price tag, etc. &#8212; I&#8217;m more interested in the little quirks that might not be showstoppers, but which were non-obvious at first and which would make it frustrating to use. The good news is that many of these problems can be addressed in software updates. We&#8217;ll have to wait and see how soon those start landing.

Apologies in advance for not providing attributions for these reports &#8212; if you&#8217;re one of the people who pointed one of these problems, you know who you are.

## System-Wide Problems

  * By design, there&#8217;s no visible file system for the iPhone. This has a lot of ramifications in terms of limitations on other features.
  * There&#8217;s no support for copy-and-paste between applications.
  * Landscape orientation for the onscreen keyboard is only available in Safari. For other applications (namely, Mail) it&#8217;s always in portrait orientation.
  * You can&#8217;t purchase music or videos from the iTunes store, directly from your iPhone. You must purchase them via the desktop application and then sync them to the iPhone.
  * The built-in Google Maps application doesn&#8217;t know where you are, even though one of the commercials suggested that. There&#8217;s no built-in GPS, so it can&#8217;t know where you are. You can, however, bookmark certain locations (such as your home or office) to use as starting points for directions.
  * You can&#8217;t sync via Bluetooth or Wi-Fi; you must use the standard USB cable.
  * No support for MMS messaging (only SMS).
  * No iChat application.
  * You can&#8217;t compose notes on the desktop and then sync them to iPhone; you must compose notes directly on the iPhone.
  * You can&#8217;t record video with the iPhone&#8217;s built-in camera; it&#8217;s only good for still photos.

## Problems with Mail

  * There&#8217;s no Junk mail filter built-in to the Mail application. This is not a big deal for me as Gmail does a pretty thorough job of spam-filtering on the server side, but it is nevertheless a curious omission.
  * You can&#8217;t attach a picture to an e-mail message from within the Mail application; you must switch over to the Photo album, select a picture and click the &#8220;Send&#8221; (or is it &#8220;Share&#8221;?) button. This presumably also means that you can&#8217;t send multiple pictures in the same e-mail message.
  * There&#8217;s no way to reply to an e-mail without quoting some part of that message. You can&#8217;t, for example, select the relevant part of the original message and then click &#8220;Reply&#8221; like you can in the desktop Mail.app.

## Problems with Safari

  * The browser doesn&#8217;t yet support Flash, so web sites that rely heavily on that technology (such as [Homestar Runner](http://www.homestarrunner.com/)) won&#8217;t work.
  * Safari doesn&#8217;t cache pages that you&#8217;ve recently visited. If you navigate away from a page and then click the &#8220;Back&#8221; button, Safari reloads that page.
  * You can&#8217;t download arbitrary files from web sites and sync them to your desktop for later use.
