It&#8217;s old news &#8212; from about a year ago, actually &#8212; but Palm has once again shafted Mac users by providing their [Palm TX Enterprise Security Update](http://www.palm.com/us/support/downloads/tx/txupdate.html) (which adds support for stronger Wi-Fi encryption methods and authentication protocols) via a Windows-only installation process. Someone has probably figured out a hack to get this to work with Macs, but it&#8217;s just one more example of how little Palm values its Mac-based customers.

I hope that Apple **destroys** the market for Treos with the iPhone. It would serve Palm right.
