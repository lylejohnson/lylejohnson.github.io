I can&#8217;t believe I waited this long to try Apple&#8217;s [Pages](http://www.apple.com/iwork/pages/) word processor. I&#8217;ve gotten increasingly frustrated trying to use Microsoft Word (from Office v.X) to lay out the [AKAA](http://www.auburnknightsalumni.org/) newsletter, and have found Pages to be a lot easier to use.

One of the primary things I like about Pages is a feature that it didn&#8217;t borrow from Word: the disappearing frames trick. For whatever reason &#8212; and I admit that it&#8217;s probably something I don&#8217;t understand about Word&#8217;s workings &#8212; text boxes and images will often hop around, or just _disappear_, if I insert (or delete) text from a page. I&#8217;ve tried different approaches to make a text frame &#8220;stick&#8221; to the spot where I place it on a page, but nothing seems to work. This makes for a very fragile editing experience, and Pages doesn&#8217;t suffer from this at all.

Some problems I&#8217;ve run into: 

  1. There doesn&#8217;t seem to be a way to specify different formatting for left and right pages&#8217; headers and footers. More specifically, I&#8217;d like the page number to appear flush left on the left pages, and flush right on the right pages.Â 
  2. There has to be at least some text content on a page, or Pages will try to get rid of it. In other words, if all of the content on a page consists of text boxes, images, etc. you&#8217;ll need to add some invisible dummy text (like a carriage return, or some spaces) somewhere on the page to make it &#8220;stick&#8221;.
  3. When I insert a new text box, Pages always seems to place it in some awkward place, disrupting the text around it in the process. I still haven&#8217;t figured out the scheme it&#8217;s using for the initial text box position.
  4. A minor thing, but there&#8217;s no easy way to create drop caps as you can in Word. The solution in Pages involves creating a text box and then fiddling with its size to make it look right. I&#8217;m not sure what to expect from Pages 2 (whenever it sees the light of day), but given Apple&#8217;s recent track record for making really 

_useful_ updates to their software applications (and operating system), I suspect I&#8217;ll be a customer.
