&#8220;What is it that you _like_ about this movie?&#8221; Denise asked, and I believe that she meant that in the most loving way.

She was patiently waiting as I finished watching the last few minutes of [&#8220;Time Bandits&#8221;](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0081633/). After having it sit on my [Amazon.com wish list](http://www.amazon.com/gp/registry/wishlist/27GOXAV85S90R/) for several years with no hope of rescue, I finally went out and bought myself a copy. Had to use up that Madison Square Mall gift card somehow.

I was seriously into this movie as a pre-teen, and I&#8217;ve wanted to own a copy of it for awhile now. It&#8217;s a little disturbing to see the movie&#8217;s somewhat dark ending (no spoilers!) and have no memory of finding it disturbing when I was a kid. But other than that, it was a lot of fun to see it again and see how much of I still remember after 20+ years. I guess &#8220;Time Bandits&#8221; was a kind of gateway to Monty Python for me, because I don&#8217;t remember knowing about the Pythons before seeing this movie. It was also the first Terry Gilliam movie I ever saw, and although he&#8217;s one of my favorite directors now, I don&#8217;t think that the fact that he directed &#8220;Time Bandits&#8221; meant anything to me at the time.

If you didn&#8217;t see it then, well, you&#8217;re probably not going to get much out of it now. I&#8217;ll readily admit that a big part of my enjoyment is the whole nostalgia factor. But if you saw this movie as a kid and loved it like I did, do yourself a favor and rent it sometime.
