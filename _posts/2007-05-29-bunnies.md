We have a nest of baby bunny rabbits just outside our living room window. We&#8217;ve had rabbits living around the house as long as we&#8217;ve lived here, and I think they&#8217;ve built nests under our deck at various times, but this is the first nest we&#8217;ve seen out in plain sight. We could see two of the babies this morning, and Denise later counted two more, for a total of four. She has named them &#8220;Flopsy-Tail&#8221;, &#8220;Mopsy-Tail&#8221;, &#8220;Bopsy-Tail&#8221; and &#8220;Topsy-Tail&#8221;. Here is a picture of Flopsy-Tail (or is it Mopsy-Tail?) peeking out of the nest.
