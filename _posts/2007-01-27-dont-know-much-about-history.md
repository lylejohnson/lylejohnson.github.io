The other night our oldest niece, Julien, called to ask Denise what she thought were the ten most important historical events in her (Julien&#8217;s) lifetime. Julien was born in 1992 &#8212; how can she be almost fifteen years old? &#8212; so you&#8217;d think we&#8217;d be able to come up with ten significant world events for that period of time, but it was kinda difficult to do on the spot. Here&#8217;s what Denise came up with (in no particular order): 

  1. 9/11 
      * The Oklahoma City Bombing 
          * War in Iraq 
              * Election and re-election of George W. Bush 
                  * Execution of Saddam Hussein 
                      * Death of Mother Teresa (she _is_ dead, right?) 
                          * Death of Princess Diana 
                              * Hurricane Katrina 
                                  * Space Shuttle Discovery explodes shortly after takeoff 
                                      * The Y2K panic </ol></p> 
                                        Yes, we now know that it was the Columbia that blew up, not Discovery. It&#8217;s hard to keep those names straight. And the list is pretty US-centric, and some of those events are clearly more historically significant than others. What do you think you would have added to the list? No fair looking up sources on the web &#8212; see what you can come up with off the top of your head.
                                        
                                        Fun side note: Julien told us that her father&#8217;s Y2K preparations consisted of going to the grocery store and buying a can of beans and a can of carrots, and then coming home and filling up one of the bathtubs with water. He was angry because he felt like none of his other family members were taking the threat as seriously as he was.
