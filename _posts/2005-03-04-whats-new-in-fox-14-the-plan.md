It&#8217;s been close to a month since the FOX 1.4.0 [release](http://www.fox-toolkit.com/news.html) and I still haven&#8217;t begun putting together a &#8220;What&#8217;s New&#8221; document to help folks (including myself) make the transition to that version. The reality is that if I take the same approach as I did for the FOX 1.2 release, and wait until I&#8217;ve documented _all_ of the changes before releasing the document, you&#8217;ll probably _never_ see it.

For that reason, I think a better approach is to try to report on everything in a series of articles. I still need to try to outline what each of those articles would cover, but in a lot of ways this could make the information a lot more &#8220;digestible&#8221; for the reader. For example, one of the things that I was dissatisfied with in [&#8220;What&#8217;s New in FOX 1.2&#8243;](http://www.knology.net/%7Elyle/fox/1.2/WhatsNew.html) was the grab-bag feel of some of the sections, like &#8220;Miscellaneous API Changes&#8221;. By organizing the material into a number of shorter articles, I have the opportunity to group related changes together and provide more context.
