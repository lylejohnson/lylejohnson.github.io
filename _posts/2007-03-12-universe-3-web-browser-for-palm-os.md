Via [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/software/palm-os/early-adopter-download-of-the-day-universe-3-beta-palm-243247.php "Lifehacker article about Universe 3"), news of [Universe 3](http://www.wapuniverse.com/ "Universe 3 Home Page"), a new open source web browser for Palm OS. If you&#8217;ve used [Blazer](http://www.palm.com/us/products/handhelds/tx/blazer.epl "Blazer Product Description Page") (Palm&#8217;s built-in web browser software) or [Opera Mini](http://www.operamini.com/ "Opera Mini Home Page"), you know that browsing the web on a Palm handheld can sometimes be an exercise in frustration. Despite its &#8220;Release Candidate 1&#8243; status, it sounds as though a lot of users are running into problems using Universe 3, and so I&#8217;m not going to actually download it at the moment. I just wish I could get to their developers [blog](http://blog.openmobl.com/ "OpenMobl Developers' Blog") (which seems to be down at the moment) to see else they&#8217;ve got planned.
