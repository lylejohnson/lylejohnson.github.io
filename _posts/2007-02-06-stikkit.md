Merlin Mann has just [announced](http://www.43folders.com/2007/02/01/merlin-stikkit-board/) his involvement (as a member of the advisory board) with [Stikkit](http://www.stikkit.com/), which looks like a really interesting new web application. I am still watching their screencasts and trying to figure out how (if) I could make use of this, but I&#8217;m already especially interested in how they extract data (like contact information, event dates, and such) from freeform text. I do wonder how robust it is and how easy it is to correct Stikkit when it makes a bad guess about what kind of information you&#8217;re entering.

Anyways. Have you played around with Stikkit yet? What did you think?
