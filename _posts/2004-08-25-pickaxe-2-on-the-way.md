I was digging around the Pragmatic Programmers&#8217; [web site](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/), trying to find a copy of a presentation that [Andy](http://www.toolshed.com/blog) gave at the first Ruby Conference about how to subversively introduce Ruby into your company, when I came across the new information page for the upcoming second edition of [_Programming Ruby_](http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/titles/ruby/index.html).

If I weren&#8217;t going to be receiving a free copy as an attendee of the upcoming [4th International Ruby Conference](http://www.rubycentral.org/conference/), I&#8217;d be placing my pre-order right now. If you&#8217;re interested in learning Ruby, or if you&#8217;re looking for what is sure to be the definitive reference, you will want to pick up a copy as soon as humanly possible. Ask anybody.
