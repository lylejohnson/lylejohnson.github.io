So I&#8217;ve decided that it&#8217;s time to move on to a more advanced blogging solution. [Blogger](http://www.blogger.com/) has been a good solution for me these past few years. [One of the other sites I administer](http://www.auburnknightsalumni.org/) is still &#8220;Powered by Blogger,&#8221; and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. Blogger is still where I&#8217;d direct someone who was interested in setting up their own blog, especially if they weren&#8217;t all that computer literate. But at this point I&#8217;m feeling a little constrained by the black box that is Blogger, and especially the inability to easily customize it.

My new blogging software will almost certainly be [Typo](http://typo.leetsoft.com/trac/), although [WordPress](http://wordpress.org/) is waiting in the wings if things don&#8217;t work out with Typo. I downloaded Typo 2.6.0, the stable release, and am experimenting with it at home. I was pleased at how easy it was to get Typo up and running, at least with the WEBrick server option. I downloaded [Origami](http://typo.leevigraham.com/), the winner of a recent [Typo themes contest](http://www.typogarden.com/articles/2005/12/10/final-results), and it looks very nice indeed.

One issue that I&#8217;m going to have to deal with is what to do with the existing blog entries from my Blogger account. The first option is to just leave this blog as-is, and start from scratch with Typo. In that scenario, existing links to this blog (if they&#8217;re out there) won&#8217;t get broken. What I _don&#8217;t_ know is how Typo will react if it&#8217;s presented with a URL for one of those older articles. A different option is to try to import the old articles into Typo. Typo doesn&#8217;t have a converter utility for Blogger blogs, but [this guy](http://cory.vanderjagt.ws/typo/articles/2005/11/25/the-switch) has written about his experience in moving from Blogger to Typo, and describes (among other things) how he migrated his Blogger data to Typo using Typo&#8217;s RSS feed importing tool.

Another issue that I need to investigate is whether [my ISP](http://www.a2hosting.com/) supports Typo. I know that they support Ruby and Rails, and worst case I can probably upload the Typo files to my account. I briefly considered switching to [Planet Argon](http://www.planetargon.com/), which offers a really inexpensive [Typo hosting plan](http://www.planetargon.com/typo_hosting.html), but they still haven&#8217;t responded to the inquiry that I e-mailed to them yesterday and I&#8217;m getting other reports that the service just isn&#8217;t there. And that&#8217;s too bad, since they&#8217;re probably nice folks, but what can you do? The only other ISP I would seriously consider switching to at this point is [A Small Orange](http://www.asmallorange.com/). I&#8217;m already hosting another web site there, and I&#8217;ve been pleased with the service and uptime.
