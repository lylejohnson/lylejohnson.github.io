The [FXRuby book](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fxruby/) has been available for a few weeks now and some of the early reviews are beginning to come in, so I wanted to do a quick roundup of what people are saying about it: 

  * Peter Cooper [reviewed](http://www.rubyinside.com/fxruby-create-lean-and-mean-guis-with-ruby-868.html) the book for the popular [Ruby Inside](http://www.rubyinside.com/ "Ruby Inside") blog, saying &#8220;Windows and Linux Ruby developers could find FOX, FXRuby and this book an excellent path into developing GUI applications with Ruby.&#8221; 
  * Werner Schuster of InfoQ [interviewed](http://www.infoq.com/articles/johnson-fxruby-book-excerpt) me about [FOX](http://www.fox-toolkit.org/), and the implementation of FXRuby. This article includes a special exclusive chapter from the new book. 
  * Jesper de Jong [reviewed](http://saloon.javaranch.com/cgi-bin/ubb/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=49&t=000767) the book and gave it 8 out of 10 horseshoes, writing &#8220;I like the way the book is set up; if you&#8217;re new to FXRuby, like I was when I started reading the book, then the first part is a nice and easy tutorial, and the second part is a good reference to most of FXRuby&#8217;s features if you&#8217;re using it in your own applications. So the book is useful for beginners and experienced users alike.&#8221; 

If you&#8217;re interested in reviewing the book for your web site, blog, podcast, newsletter or public access television show, please [let me know](mailto:lyle@lylejohnson.name)!
