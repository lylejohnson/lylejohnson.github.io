Was watching [&#8220;Hardball with Chris Matthews&#8221;](http://hardball.msnbc.com) last night, when he was interviewing Donna Brazile (Al Gore&#8217;s campaign manager for the 2000 U.S. Presidential Campaign). Somehow, she managed to work in the word [_gravitas_](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=gravitas) to describe Senator John Edwards, the recently-announced running mate for John Kerry. I thought we had managed to bury this poor word after the 2000 campaign, but maybe Ms. Brazile is just frozen in time and can&#8217;t let go, bless her heart.

Every year, the Lake Superior State University&#8217;s Word Banishment Selection Committee publishes its [&#8220;List of Words Banished from the Queen&#8217;s English for Mis-Use, Over-Use and General Uselessness&#8221;](http://www.lssu.edu/banished/). This year&#8217;s [list](http://www.lssu.edu/banished/archive/2004.php) includes such gems as &#8220;metrosexual&#8221;, &#8220;bling-bling&#8221; and &#8220;shock and awe&#8221;, but a search of all the words banned to date didn&#8217;t turn up &#8220;gravitas&#8221;. I&#8217;ve now made my nomination; wish me luck.
