[foxGUIb](http://fox-tool.rubyforge.org/ "foxGUIb Home Page") is a tool developed by Meinrad Recheis (aka Henon) that you can use to interactively build user interfaces for [FXRuby](http://www.fxruby.org/ "FXRuby Home Page"). The project&#8217;s [home page](http://fox-tool.rubyforge.org/ "foxGUIb Home Page") includes some screen shots and general information about its use, and Mike Parr has contributed a [user guide](http://www.mikeparr.info/rubyguib/foxguibhome.htm "foxGUIb guide") to help you get started with its use.

Henon has just announced that he&#8217;s making plans for the 1.0 release of foxGUIb, and he&#8217;s [asking](http://groups.google.com/group/ruby-talk-google/browse_thread/thread/bced5ed9ca9a244a?hl=en) you for your requests in terms of desired features and changes for the software. If you have suggestions for him, or would like to pitch in and help out with that project, be sure to follow up with him!
