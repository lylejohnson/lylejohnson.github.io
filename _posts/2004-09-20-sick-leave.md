So, long story short, I&#8217;m going to have some surgery this week and will thus be unable to attend this year&#8217;s Ruby Conference. I should be nearing the end of my recovery by the time the conference rolls around, but will probably be unable to travel (comfortably) by that time. It&#8217;s a drag, since I enjoyed the first three so much and was looking forward to seeing everyone again this year.

Once I&#8217;ve recovered and am up to speed, I still plan to put together a presentation or article on Ruby and RDF. As I&#8217;ve discussed in some previous blog posts, there are a number of interesting RDF-related projects under development. In the spirit of looking for a silver lining and all that, this may be the opportunity I&#8217;d been looking for: to try to get something published in one of the popular programming magazines (like _Dr. Dobbs Journal_ or _Linux Journal_). We&#8217;ll see.
