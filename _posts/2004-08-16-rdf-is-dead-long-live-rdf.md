Shelley Powers, author of [_Practical RDF_](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0596002637/104-7217890-1801542), has posted a new [article](http://rdf.burningbird.net/archives/2004/08/the-rdf-glass-ceiling/) about what she calls the &#8220;RDF Glass Ceiling&#8221;. The article comments on the apparent loss of momentum in the RDF world in the year since her book was published.

The follow-up comments from readers are a little more encouraging. Danny Ayers notes that while there hasn&#8217;t exactly been an avalanche of new RDF-based projects lately, the number of new people showing up on RDF interest mailing lists and IRC channels has been picking up. He also notes that it&#8217;s only been six months since RDF and OWL became official W3C recommendations. Other responses to Shelley&#8217;s article seem to reinforce Danny&#8217;s opinion that general interest in RDF is steadily picking up steam in a sort-of &#8220;grasssroots&#8221; way.
