The [next meeting](http://www.meetup.com/hsv-rb/calendar/15674137/) of hsv.rb (the Huntsville Ruby Users Group) will be held this Thursday, December 16, at 11:30 a.m. The location is the [HudsonAlpha Institute](http://maps.google.com/maps?client=safari&rls=en&oe=UTF-8&um=1&ie=UTF-8&q=hudsonalpha&fb=1&gl=us&hq=hudsonalpha&ei=e08GTfOYCIT48Ab-9sX1CA&sa=X&oi=local_group&ct=image&resnum=2&ved=0CAQQtgMwAQ), and it sounds like we&#8217;ll be meeting in a room &#8220;on the first floor facing the atrium on the bistro side.&#8221; So there you go. If you&#8217;d like to buy lunch there and just bring it to the meeting, you can stop by the [Atrium Cafe](http://www.hudsonalpha.org/atrium-caf√©).

Bryan Powell will be leading a discussion of [MacRuby](http://www.macruby.org/), which is an implementation of Ruby on the Objective-C runtime. [Here](http://intridea.com/2010/11/22/build-a-mac-application-from-scratch-using-macruby-and-hotcocoa) is a nice introductory article that demonstrates how to build a simple Cocoa application in Ruby, using MacRuby.

Another topic of discussion is the hsv.rb community project. There&#8217;s been some discussion of it [here](http://www.meetup.com/hsv-rb/messages/boards/thread/9977196), but the goal is to nail down some plans so that we can start this in earnest in the new year.
