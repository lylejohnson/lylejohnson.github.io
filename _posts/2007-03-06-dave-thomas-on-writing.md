Dave Thomas of the Pragmatic Programmers has [written](http://pragdave.pragprog.com/pragdave/2007/03/sywtwab_1_so_yo.html) the first of what he promises will be a series of articles on writing books. Given that Dave has yet to write a book that wasn&#8217;t widely appreciated and wildly successful, this seems like a good series to keep an eye on.
