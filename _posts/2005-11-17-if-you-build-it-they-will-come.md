Well, I just got my first spam message (of sorts) from a 43 thingster:

>   Message from mindyfine: I saw one of your things is to change someone's life. You could make a HUGE difference in my husbands life by helping him win $10,000 to help pursue his small business plans...</tt></blockquote>Umm, no, Mindy (may I call you Mindy?) I currently have 19 things in my list, and &#8220;changing someone&#8217;s life&#8221; isn&#8217;t one of them. Never has been. When mysterious Nigerians contact me out of the blue with an e-mail like this, they at least have the decency to be offering me something in return for my assistance.
