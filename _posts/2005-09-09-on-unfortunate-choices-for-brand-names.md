I saw a case of Coca-Cola&#8217;s latest offering, [&#8220;Sprite Remix Aruba Jam&#8221;](http://www.spriteremix.com/), when I stopped at Publix on the way home from work this evening. I really hope they&#8217;re not trying to market this in [Mountain Brook](http://www.al.com/news/birminghamnews/index.ssf?/base/news/1125653141142050.xml&coll=2).
