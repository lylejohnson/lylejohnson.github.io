[Ruby Central, Inc.](http://www.rubycentral.org/) is an organization founded by David A. Black and [Chad Fowler](http://www.chadfowler.com) for the purpose of supporting Ruby activities (such as the annual [International Ruby Conference](http://www.rubyconf.com/)).

Ruby Central has recently [announced](http://www.rubycentral.org/grant/announce.html) a grant program to support local or regional groups of Ruby programmers who wish to organize a &#8220;codefest&#8221; aimed at developing new, high-quality Ruby libraries. The goal is to fill identifiable gaps in Ruby library functionality, but we&#8217;re not looking for anything specific; part of the application process involves your explanation of why this functionality is needed. A total of $1500 will be awarded, with a maximum of $500 per group.

If you&#8217;d like to [apply](http://www.rubycentral.org/grant/application.html) for one of these grants, get busy! The rules and guidelines are listed on the [application form](http://www.rubycentral.org/grant/application.html), and the deadline for submissions has been extended to January 30.
