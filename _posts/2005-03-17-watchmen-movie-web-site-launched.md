It has seemed for a while now that the [Watchmen](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watchmen) movie was doomed, but it looks like Paramount has recently launched an official [Web site](http://www.watchmenmovie.com/) for the movie. [Paul Greengrass](http://imdb.com/name/nm0339030/) is the latest in a long series of directors associated with this project, [David Hayter](http://imdb.com/name/nm0371684/)&#8216;s is the latest screenplay, and as for casting, well, nothing official and the rumors are just out of control.

I hope they don&#8217;t screw this up.
