Have the [Atlanta Bread Company](http://www.atlantabread.com/ "Atlanta Bread Company Home Page") and [Panera Bread Company](http://www.panerabread.com/ "Panera Bread Company Home Page") merged?

</table> The picture on the left shows Atlanta Bread&#8217;s old logo, courtesy of yesterday morning&#8217;s bag, which I just fished out of the trash. The one on the right is from this morning&#8217;s bag. It&#8217;s awfully reminiscent of the 

[Panera Bread Company](http://www.panerabread.com/ "Panera Bread Company Home Page") logo, don&#8217;t you think?

I think it&#8217;s the font that they&#8217;re using, which appears to be the same font that Panera uses. And yet a quick Google search doesn&#8217;t turn up anything to indicate that the two companies have merged or anything like that.
