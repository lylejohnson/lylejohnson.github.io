We just got back from seeing the 4:30 show of [&#8220;The Queen&#8221;](http://imdb.com/title/tt0436697/) at the Carmike Cinemas (which, by the way, seems to have become increasingly ghetto since the Rave opened up in South Huntsville last year.) So that makes two Oscar-nominated films that I&#8217;ve seen, which I believe is two more than last year.

We thought for awhile that we were going to be the youngest people there, but a group of teenaged girls showed up at the last minute during previews.

I had not read anything about the movie beforehand and so I didn&#8217;t know what to expect, but I highly recommend it, even if you aren&#8217;t particularly interested in the comings and goings of the British Royal Family. The movie covers the week following the death of Princess Diana and presents what I thought was a very sympathetic portrayal of the Queen. [Helen Mirren](http://imdb.com/name/nm0000545/) deserves her Oscar nomination, but I&#8217;m surprised that there hasn&#8217;t been more buzz about [Michael Sheen](http://imdb.com/name/nm0790688/), the fellow who played Prime Minister Tony Blair. They (whoever they are) also did a great job of mixing news footage from the time with the action in the movie &#8212; it was really seamless and made the whole thing more believable. Of course, a lot of the private conversations that the movie shows have to have been fictionalized, and so you wonder how accurate it really is.

Anyways. Good movie, go see it if you can.
