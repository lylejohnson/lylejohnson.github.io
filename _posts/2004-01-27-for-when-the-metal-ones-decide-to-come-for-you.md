This week&#8217;s top story at [The Onion](http://www.theonion.com) is [&#8220;Scientists Abandon AI Project After Seeing _The Matrix_.&#8221;](http://www.theonion.com/4003/top_story.html) Favorite quote: &#8220;I want no hand in creating a world where only Keanu Reeves can protect my great-grandchildren from a giant drill that plummets through the ceilings of subterranean cave dwellings.&#8221;

Good stuff, and I was once again reminded of my all-time favorite Saturday Night Live commercial parody, for [Old Glory Robot Insurance](http://www.robotcombat.com/video_oldglory_hi.html). The point in that skit when Sam Waterston (the celebrity endorser) almost loses it is priceless.
