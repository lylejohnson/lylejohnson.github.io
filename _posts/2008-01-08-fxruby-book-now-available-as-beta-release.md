I&#8217;m pleased to report that <cite><a title="FXRuby Book Page at Pragmatic Bookshelf site" href="http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fxruby">FXRuby: Create Lean and Mean GUIs with Ruby</a></cite> has been released as a Beta book. That means that although the book is still under development, you can get early access to the content right now and provide feedback to help make the final book even better when it&#8217;s released later this year. We&#8217;re getting very close to a completed first draft and I can assure you that it&#8217;s well worth it to go ahead and [get the book now](http://www.pragprog.com/titles/fxruby) if you&#8217;re anxious to get started with FXRuby programming.

As I&#8217;ve noted before, this is the first book ever dedicated to the subject of [FOX](http://www.fox-toolkit.org/) and [FXRuby](http://www.fxruby.org/) application development. It&#8217;s intended for software developers who are already comfortable with [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) programming and who want to learn how to develop GUI applications with Ruby. No prior experience with GUI development is needed, but it’s intended to be useful both to newcomers as well as those who have worked with other GUI toolkits in the past.

The purpose of this book is to give you a head start on developing GUI applications with [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org/) and [FXRuby](http://www.fxruby.org/) through a combination of tutorial exercises and focused technical information. It isn’t a comprehensive book on [FXRuby](http://www.fxruby.org/) programming, and it’s not a reference manual. What this book _will_ do is get you over the initial conceptual hurdles and equip you with the practical information that you need to build your own applications.
