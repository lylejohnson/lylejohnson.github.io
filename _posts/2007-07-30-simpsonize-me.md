      I spent last weekend down in Auburn, for the Auburn Knights Reunion, and since I had some time to kill on Saturday afternoon, I thought about going to see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0462538/" title="The Simpsons Movie (IMDb Entry)">The Simpsons Movie</a>. Luckily, I decided not to, since Denise now tells me that she wants to see it too. This is even though she gets on to me for watching the show. I knew she was a closet fan. This morning someone pointed out the new <a href="http://simpsonizeme.com/" title="Simpsonize Me Web Site">&#8220;Simpsonize Me&#8221; </a>web site (a sort of joint promotional thing between the movie and Burger King). It&#8217;s a lot of fun: just provide a digital photo of yourself, and get a (tweakable) &#8220;Simpsonized&#8221; version of yourself.
