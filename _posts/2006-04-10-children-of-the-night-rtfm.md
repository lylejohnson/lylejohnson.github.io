Amy Hoy of [Slash7](http://www.slash7.com/) has written a [guide](http://www.slash7.com/pages/vampires) to help software developers spot &#8220;help vampires&#8221;: 

> Identifying Help Vampires can be tricky, because they look like any ordinary person (or internet user, whichever is lesser). But by closely observing an individual&#8217;s behavior using this handy checklist, you too can identify Help Vampires in the field:
> 
>   * Does he ask the same, tired questions others ask (at a rate of once or more per minute)? 
>       * Does he clearly lack the ability or inclination to ask the almighty Google? 
>           * Does he refuse to take the time to ask coherent, specific questions? 
>               * Does he think helping him must be the high point of your day? 
>                   * Does he get offensive, as if you need to prove to him why he should use Ruby on Rails? 
>                       * Is he obviously just waiting for some poor, well-intentioned person to do all his thinking for him? 
>                           * Can you tell he really isn&#8217;t interested in having his question answered, so much as getting someone else to do his work?</ul></blockquote>Read the whole thing, especially if you&#8217;ve taken to sleeping a lot more during the daytime as of late.</p>
