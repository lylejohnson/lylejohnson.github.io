You know, I&#8217;ve seen references to [co.mments](http://co.mments.com/) for awhile now, but for some reason my brain filtered it into the &#8220;look at later&#8221; pile.

[co.mments](http://co.mments.com/) is a service that assists you in tracking the conversations that take place in the comments for a blog post. If you are in the habit of reading blogs, I think you&#8217;ll agree that some of the most interesting information comes out of the responses from readers, and the back-and-forth between the author and readers. Some blogs of course provide RSS feeds for a posts&#8217; comments &#8212; at least, I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve seen that before &#8212; but it&#8217;s not something I see universally. So co.mments provides you with a central place to track all of those conversations, and includes such niceties as a bookmarklet for tracking the post you&#8217;re currently viewing, an RSS feed for all of your tracked conversations, and e-mail notifications of changes to those conversations.
