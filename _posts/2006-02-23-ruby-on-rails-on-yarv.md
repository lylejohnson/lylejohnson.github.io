I haven&#8217;t been keeping up with &#8220;YARV&#8221;:http://www.atdot.net/yarv/ development as well as I should, but luckily &#8220;why&#8221;:http://whytheluckystiff.net/ is doing it for me. He passes on the &#8220;news&#8221;:http://redhanded.hobix.com/inspect/yarvNoLongerAnAcronymForYouAcknowledgeTheReekOfVapors.html that Ruby veteran Minero Aoki now has Rails running on the latest release of YARV.
