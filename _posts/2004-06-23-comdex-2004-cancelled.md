CNET is [reporting](http://news.com.com/Organizer+cancels+Comdex+2004/2100-7341_3-5244406.html) that the Comdex computer trade show has been cancelled for 2004. Apparently attendance has been dropping off for several years.

I remember getting passes to Comdex once when it was held in Atlanta. This was probably in the late eighties or early nineties; I know that I was still in college. We ate lunch at a Houston&#8217;s steak house and of course loaded up on a lot of free stuff at the show. It&#8217;s funny to see this story today because I recently discovered an &#8220;I&#8217;m Sticking With DOS&#8221; button that I must have picked up at a Digital Research booth, back when [DR-DOS](http://stud3.tuwien.ac.at/~e0225895/drdos/drdos.htm) still existed.
