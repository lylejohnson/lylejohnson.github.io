The [SIMILE](http://simile.mit.edu/) project has announced a new major release of the [Piggy Bank](http://simile.mit.edu/piggy-bank/) extension for the [Mozilla Firefox browser](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/). Developer Stefano Mazzocchi has blogged about it [here](http://www.betaversion.org/~stefano/linotype/news/89/). I&#8217;ve only just now downloaded the new version, but it looks like they&#8217;ve made some substantial improvements over the original version (which itself was fun to play with).

To install this extension into Firefox, visit the [Piggy Bank](http://simile.mit.edu/piggy-bank/) home page and click the [get Piggy Bank](http://simile.mit.edu/dist/piggy-bank/piggy-bank.xpi) link in the upper right-hand corner of the page.
