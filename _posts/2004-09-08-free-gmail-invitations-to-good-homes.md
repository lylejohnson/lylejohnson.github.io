As of this writing I have six [Gmail](http://gmail.google.com) invitations, so if you are one of those few people who wants a Gmail account and doesn&#8217;t already have one, just [send me an e-mail](mailto:lyle.johnson@gmail.com). The invitations seem to be pretty free-flowing these days and I&#8217;m guessing this means that Google is getting ready to go live with Gmail. So far I&#8217;m only using my account for mailing list subscriptions, but it does have a nice interface compared to the other Webmail services I&#8217;ve tried.

**Update**: All the invitations have been handed out.
