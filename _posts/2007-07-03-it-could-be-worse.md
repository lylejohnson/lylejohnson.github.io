As seen on [MacRumors.com](http://forums.macrumors.com/showpost.php?p=3860185&postcount=69), in response to a complaint about the cost of an iPhone replacement battery: 

> &#8220;If you can&#8217;t afford the phone, don&#8217;t buy it. If you like your current phone better, do not buy the iPhone. Why are you making this so hard on yourself? It could be worse. You could be in Darfur. iPhones aren&#8217;t even available there.&#8221;
