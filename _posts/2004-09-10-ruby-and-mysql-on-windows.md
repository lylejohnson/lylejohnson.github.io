Justin Rudd has [written](http://seagecko.org/thoughts/index.php?p=28) about his experience trying to get the MySQL extension for Ruby to build properly on Windows. It seems as though I had to do this once upon a time and ran into similar headaches. One wonders why this extension isn&#8217;t included in the [one-click installer](http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyinstaller/) for Ruby.
