I&#8217;ve just installed James McKay&#8217;s [Comment Timeout](http://www.jamesmckay.net/code/comment-timeout/) plugin for WordPress in an effort to thwart the occasional spammer that slips past [Akismet](http://www.akismet.com/). I&#8217;m a little concerned because a few comments on James&#8217; blog suggest that it may not be working properly for some WordPress and/or PHP versions, but I guess I&#8217;ll just wait and see.
