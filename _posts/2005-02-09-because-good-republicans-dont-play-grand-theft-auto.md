So my employer gave me a nice gift card for use at the [local shopping mall](http://www.madisonsquaremall.com/), and I&#8217;ve been trying to figure out exactly what I can spend it on. I generally try to avoid the mall and just don&#8217;t do a lot of shopping there anymore. But I was there today, buying Valentine&#8217;s Day stuff for the wife and realized what it is I&#8217;d like to buy for myself (as if I&#8217;d spend that gift card on anyone else).

No, it&#8217;s not one of those [giant cookies](http://www.greatamericancookies.com/products-cookie_cakes.php). No, it&#8217;s not a [remote-controlled Monster Truck](http://www.radioshack.com/partners/zipzaps/zipzapshome.asp?cat=006d) from Radio Shack. It is _[Myst IV: Revelation](http://www.mystrevelation.com/)_, the latest game in the _[Myst](http://www.myst.com/)_ franchise. I&#8217;ve been a fan of these games for a long time, from way back when I borrowed a co-worker&#8217;s copy of _Myst_ and stayed up way too late for way too many nights trying to finish it.

Technically, since I have not yet finished _Myst III: Exile_, you might say that I need to hold off on buying yet another _Myst_ game. To you, I say: Mind your own business. I want it. The problem, however, is that there seem to be a [number](http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/vt3/25031&mode=feedback&vid=All) of [technical](http://www.insidemacgames.com/reviews/user_reviews.php?ID=534) [problems](http://forums.ubi.com/eve/ubb.x?a=tpc&s=400102&f=580100736&m=8111064552) that would make it frustrating (if not impossible) to play the game on my Apple PowerBook running Mac OS X v10.3.7. So it looks like I have a little more research to do first, to see if there are workarounds to the problems. And if not, I need to wait patiently until [Ubisoft](http://www.ubi.com/) gets another patch out.

_**Update:**_ In an almost freakish twist of fate, MacRumors posted [news](http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?s=&threadid=109595) of the Mac OS X Update 10.3.8 mere moments after I completed this post. I&#8217;m still going to wait and see if this update fixes things for the people who were having trouble after the 10.3.7 update, but keep your fingers crossed.
