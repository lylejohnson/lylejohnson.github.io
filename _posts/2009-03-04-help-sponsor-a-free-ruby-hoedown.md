At last year&#8217;s [Ruby Hoedown](http://www.rubyhoedown.com/), organizer Jeremy McAnally announced his intention to make this year&#8217;s Hoedown **free** for all conference attendees. Unfortunately, it seems that he hasn&#8217;t been able to enlist enough big sponsors to make that a reality, so [he is reaching out to the Ruby community for donations](http://omgbloglol.com/help-make-a-free-ruby-conferen). 

Jeremy has set a goal of $15,000, which would cover the basic costs of a venue in downtown Nashville (this year&#8217;s conference site), sound and promotional materials. Obviously, if you&#8217;re associated with a business that&#8217;s able to make a sizable donation, that would be great, but individual donations of any amount are greatly appreciated. See Jeremy&#8217;s [blog](http://omgbloglol.com/help-make-a-free-ruby-conferen) for more details about how you can participate.
