Saw on [freshmeat.net](http://freshmeat.net) this morning that Sander has a new release of the [Goggles Music Manager](http://fifthplanet.net/gmm.html). Looks like the first release of this software was back in November of last year, but somehow it slipped under my radar screen. Sander&#8217;s [Goggles DVD Player](http://www.fifthplanet.net/goggles.html) has already attracted a lot of fans over the last few years, and given the similarly clean UI for Goggles Music Manager it seems likely to do the same.
