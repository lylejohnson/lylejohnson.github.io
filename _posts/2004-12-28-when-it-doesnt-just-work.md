Since I switched over to using an Apple PowerBook a few years ago, I&#8217;ve had a number of friends ask what I like most about the PowerBook and Mac OS X. My typical answer is that when you&#8217;re working on an Apple computer, things &#8220;just work&#8221;. After having spent years working on DOS and Windows-based PCs, I remember the astonishment I felt when I first turned on the PowerBook and it connected to my wireless network with little or no help on my part; it &#8220;just worked&#8221;.

That&#8217;s why it pains to me to say that I can&#8217;t for the life of me figure out how to get Denise&#8217;s new iBook up and running on our wireless network. I know that nothing&#8217;s fundamentally wrong with the iBook: it &#8220;sees&#8221; our wireless network and can connect to it. I&#8217;ve even connected to some of our neighbors&#8217; wireless networks (in the name of science, of course) to confirm that the iBook&#8217;s built-in Airport Extreme card is working. But alas, something is preventing the iBook from getting to the internet from our wireless network.

I&#8217;m also fairly sure that nothing&#8217;s wrong with my [NETGEAR MR814v2 wireless router](http://www.netgear.com/products/details/MR814.php) either. After all, it&#8217;s the same router I&#8217;ve been using all along with my PowerBook, and it&#8217;s been upgraded to the latest possible firmware version. I prefer to have as much security in place as possible, so I typically run the network using 128-bit WEP encryption and restrict access only to certain MAC addresses. But even when I disable these features, and leave the wireless network &#8220;wide open&#8221; (as at least two of my neighbors do) the iBook won&#8217;t play nice.

I&#8217;ll keep you posted in case some miracle solution pops up. Otherwise, it looks like I&#8217;m going to reward NETGEAR by buying one of their newer routers (like [this one](http://www.netgear.com/products/details/WGR614.php)).
