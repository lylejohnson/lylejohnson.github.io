At the request of loyal reader Dan, I went in search of an option to turn on previews for comments. It looks like I have a few options to choose from, so the first one I&#8217;ve decided to experiment with is the [&#8220;Live Comment Preview&#8221;](http://dev.wp-plugins.org/wiki/LiveCommentPreview) plug-in. This one required almost no configuration (which is great), but it wasn&#8217;t immediately obvious to me that it was in fact working (which is bad). It turns out that the &#8220;live preview&#8221; doesn&#8217;t actually appear until you start typing in the comment text area. Once you do start typing, however, the preview area magically appears immediately below the comment text box and updates itself as you type. It&#8217;s a nifty little trick, but I&#8217;m going to need to get used to it. Or, rather, my readers will.

Now I just need to figure out how to correct the placement of the &#8220;Add your comment&#8221; button on Safari.
