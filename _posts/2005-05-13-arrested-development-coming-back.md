According to [this E! Online article](http://www.eonline.com/Gossip/Kristin/Archive2005/050513.html) from Kristin Veitch, it looks &#8220;very likely&#8221; that [_Arrested Development_](http://www.fox.com/arresteddev/) has been picked up for not only one but _two_ full seasons. That&#8217;s pretty good news, considering it&#8217;s Friday 13th. It&#8217;s also suggested that the show will move to a new time slot, which is probably a wise idea (maybe as a lead-in to [_House_](http://www.fox.com/house/)?).

P.S. I promise that I&#8217;ll come up with some topic other than the fate of _Arrested Development_ for the next post.
