Assaf Arkin [blogs](http://blog.labnotes.org/2007/04/18/introducing-buildr-or-how-we-cured-our-maven-blues/ "Introducing Buildr, or how we cured our Maven blues") about how his team finally gave up on [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/ "Maven Home Page") and replaced it with [Buildr](http://buildr.rubyforge.org/ "Buildr Home Page"), a build tool written in Ruby and based on [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/ "Rake Home Page"). It&#8217;s a little unfortunate that they chose a name so close to Jim Weirich&#8217;s [Builder](http://builder.rubyforge.org/ "Builder Home Page"), but what can you say or do? At any rate, it&#8217;s comforting to hear that I&#8217;m not the only one who&#8217;s looked at Maven and thought to myself that it&#8217;s an incredibly overengineered solution for the problem that it&#8217;s trying to solve.
