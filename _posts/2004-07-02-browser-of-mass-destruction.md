Yahoo! News is [reporting](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&cid=74&e=3&u=/cmp/20040702/tc_cmp/22103407) that the Department of Homeland Security&#8217;s [U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT)](http://www.us-cert.gov/) has recommended using browsers other than Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer, due to security concerns. There are a number of recommendations listed in the US-CERT [vulnerability note](http://networks.org/?src=cert:713878), but the relevant one is this: 

> _&#8220;There are a number of significant vulnerabilities in technologies relating to the IE domain/zone security model, the DHTML object model, MIME type determination, and ActiveX. It is possible to reduce exposure to these vulnerabilities by using a different web browser, especially when browsing untrusted sites. Such a decision may, however, reduce the functionality of sites that require IE-specific features such as DHTML, VBScript, and ActiveX. Note that using a different web browser will not remove IE from a Windows system, and other programs may invoke IE, the WebBrowser ActiveX control, or the HTML rendering engine (MSHTML).&#8221;_I haven&#8217;t (intentionally) used IE for several years now, but it&#8217;s still jarring to see this lack of security in what is probably still the most widely used web browser for Windows. As noted elsewhere on the web, this has prompted a number of Windows users to finally investigate their alternatives, such as the Mozilla project&#8217;s [Mozilla](http://mozilla.org/products/mozilla1.x/) and [Firefox](http://mozilla.org/products/firefox/) browsers.
